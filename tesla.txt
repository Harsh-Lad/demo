MODEL X Owner's Manual

Interior Electronics
In addition to storage compartments and cup holders
(see Interior Storage on page 39), the Model X interior
supports various electronics such as an RFID transmitter
that reads key fobs and key cards (see Keys on page 22),
USB ports, wireless phone chargers, and a 12V power
socket.

USB Ports
Model X has five USB ports:
• Two USB ports are located in the front compartment
of the center console. These can be used to charge
USB devices and to play audio files from a phone or
USB device (see Playing Media from Devices on page
172).

Glovebox USB port:

• Two USB ports are located below the rear
touchscreen that can be used to charge USB devices.
• One USB port is located inside the glovebox. This
port is equipped with a USB flash drive. The secure
location of this USB port makes it ideal for saving
Sentry Mode and Dashcam video footage.
The USB ports can output power up to approximately
27W (which may vary depending on vehicle
manufacture date).
See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos on
page 155 for information about formatting USB flash
drives.
To access the front USB ports, open the front
compartment of the center console. The front USB ports
are located on the rear wall of the compartment:

NOTE: Power is available whenever the vehicle is
considered "awake". The vehicle may be awake for many
reasons. For example, when using features such as
Summon, or when features such as Keep Climate On,
Dog Mode, Camp Mode, or Sentry Mode are enabled.
The vehicle is also awake whenever the low voltage
battery is being charged or is in use, during high voltage
charging, when the vehicle is communicating with the
mobile app, etc. Leaving an accessory plugged in does
not deplete the low voltage battery.
NOTE: Use USB 3.0 compliant cables to connect a
device to a USB port. Using non-compliant cables can
result in slower charging, potential connection problems
or degraded performance.
NOTE: Do not connect multiple devices using a USB
hub. This can prevent connected devices from charging
or from being recognized by Media Player, Sentry Mode,
Dashcam, etc.

Rear USB ports are located below the rear touchscreen:

Wireless Phone Chargers
Wireless phone chargers are integrated into both the
front and rear consoles, each providing up to 15W of
power to charge Qi-enabled phones. Simply place your
phone on the charger. Your device may feel warm while
charging, but this is a normal effect of inductive
charging.

Overview

13

Interior Electronics
NOTE: Power is available whenever the vehicle is
considered "awake". The vehicle may be awake for many
reasons. For example, when using features such as
Summon, or when features such as Cabin Overheat
Protection, Keep Climate On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode,
Sentry Mode, etc. are enabled. The vehicle is also awake
whenever the low voltage battery is being charged or is
in use, during high voltage charging, when the vehicle is
communicating with the mobile app, etc. Leaving an
accessory plugged in does not deplete the low voltage
battery.
WARNING: The power socket and an accessory’s
connector can become hot.

When placed on the wireless charger, your phone
charges whenever the vehicle is powered on (the
touchscreen is on and you are in the vehicle). Your
phone does not charge when you leave the vehicle
unless a feature, such as Sentry mode is enabled.
NOTE: The phone must be in direct contact with the
wireless charger. Do not place objects between the
phone and the charger (for example, credit cards, key
cards, coins, keys, metal objects, etc.).
NOTE: The wireless phone charger may not work if your
phone case is too large or is made of metal. Try
removing the phone from its case before placing it on
the charger.
NOTE: The wireless phone charger does not charge if
the vehicle's high voltage Battery is discharged.

Low Voltage Power Socket
Your Model X has a power socket located in the center
console's rear compartment. To access the low voltage
socket, open the front compartment of the center
console.

WARNING: To prevent excessive interference with
the vehicle’s electronics, Tesla recommends that
you do not plug any non-Tesla accessories,
including power inverters, into the low voltage
power socket. However, if you do use a non-Tesla
accessory and notice any malfunctions or
unexpected behavior, such as indicator lights, alert
messages, or excessive heat from the accessory,
unplug the accessory from the low voltage power
socket immediately.
NOTE: A power inverter plugged into the low voltage
power socket must support 16V DC input to function.
CAUTION: Do not attempt to jump start Model X
using the low voltage power socket. Doing so can
result in damage.

Active Road Noise Reduction
Model X is equipped with Active Road Noise Reduction
which reduces low-frequency road noise while driving
on rough surfaces. To accomplish this, the vehicle uses
the seat microphones to measure noise in the cabin,
then generates anti-noise through the speakers to
intelligently create quiet zones around the front
occupants depending on vehicle and environmental
factors.

The power socket is suitable for accessories requiring up
to 12A continuous draw (16A peak).

14

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Interior Electronics
To turn Active Road Noise Reduction on or off, open the
Media Player and touch Audio Settings icon > Options >
Active Road Noise Reduction (the audio settings icon
shows an equalizer with three vertical lines). This may
require several minutes of driving time to calibrate
before enabling.
NOTE: To ensure active noise reduction operates
effectively, avoid covering the microphones (with seat
covers, etc.). Active Road Noise Reduction may disable
if a window is rolled down, door is open, or the fan is
turned up. Active Road Noise Reduction also disables if
there is a rear passenger in the vehicle.
CAUTION: To prevent damage to these
microphones when cleaning, do not over-saturate
the area of the seats where the microphones are
located.

Keys
Types of Keys

◦ Your phone's general Bluetooth settings are
enabled.

Model X supports the following types of keys:

◦ Bluetooth is enabled within your phone's settings
for the Tesla mobile app. For example, on your
phone, navigate to Settings, choose the Tesla
mobile app, and ensure the Bluetooth setting is
turned on.

• Phone key - You can set up your personal phone as a
"phone key" that communicates with Model X using
Bluetooth. A phone key supports automatic locking
and unlocking.
• Key card - Tesla provides a key card that
communicates with Model X using short range radiofrequency identification (RFID) signals. The key card
is used to "authenticate" phone keys to work with
Model X and to add or remove other keys. Unlike the
phone key and key fobs, the key card does not
support automatic locking and unlocking. In
situations where your phone key has a dead battery,
or is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, drive,
and lock Model X.
• Key fob - The key fob (if equipped) allows you to
press buttons to open the front and rear trunks, and
unlock, lock, and drive Model X. The key fob also
supports automatic locking and unlocking, if available
in your region (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page
30Passive Locking and Unlocking on page 24) and
can be used as a backup to your phone key.
Model X supports a total of 19 keys, which can include
phone keys, key cards, and up to four key fobs.
CAUTION: Remember to bring a key with you
when you drive. Although you can drive Model X
away from its key, you will be unable to power it
back on after it powers off.

Phone Key
Using your phone as a key is a convenient way to access
your Model X. As you approach, your phone's Bluetooth
signal is detected and the doors unlock when you press
a door handle. Likewise, when you exit and walk away
with the phone key, doors automatically lock (provided
the Walk-Away Door Lock feature is turned on; see
Walk-Away Door Lock on page 30).
Before you can use a phone to access Model X, follow
these steps to authenticate it:
1. Download the Tesla mobile app to your phone.
2. Log into the Tesla mobile app using your Tesla
account username and password.
NOTE: You must remain logged in to your Tesla
account to use your phone to access Model X.
NOTE: If multiple vehicles are linked to your Tesla
account, you must ensure that the vehicle you want
the mobile app to access is currently selected on the
mobile app.
3. Ensure:

22

◦ Access to your location is enabled. Open the Tesla
mobile app in your phone's settings and select
Location > Always. For the best experience, keep
the mobile app running in the background.
◦ Allow Mobile Access is enabled on the vehicle
touchscreen (Controls > Safety > Allow Mobile
Access).
NOTE: Model X communicates with your phone using
Bluetooth. Keep in mind that your phone must have
enough battery power to run Bluetooth and that
many phones disable Bluetooth when the battery is
low.
4. While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla
mobile app and touch Set Up Phone Key on the main
screen, or navigate to Security > Set Up Phone Key.
Follow the prompts on the mobile app and vehicle
touchscreen to set up your phone key.
To view a list of keys that can currently access Model X,
or to remove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see
Managing Keys on page 25).
Model X can connect to three phone keys
simultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys
are detected and you want to authenticate or pair a
different phone, move the other connected phone key(s)
out of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting.
Once a phone has been authenticated, it no longer
requires an internet connection to be used as a phone
key for Model X. However, to use the phone hands-free,
access your phone's contacts, play media from it, etc.,
you must also pair it and connect it as a Bluetooth
device (see Bluetooth on page 66).
Some smartphones with NFC capability can be used to
lock/unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card.
Ensure the Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your
vehicle and enable the NFC function on your phone.
Once enabled, simply hold the phone to the driver's side
door pillar to lock or unlock the door. Refer to your
smartphone's instructions for specific information on
how to do this.

Key Fob
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, or date of manufacture, your vehicle may
not come with a key fob. Go to http://shop.tesla.com for
more information.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Keys
You can quickly familiarize yourself with the key fob by
thinking of it as a miniature version of Model X, with the
Tesla badge representing the front. The key has buttons
that feel like softer areas on the surface.

◦ Double-click to open/close the associated falcon
wing door.
◦ Single-click to stop movement of the associated
falcon wing door. Subsequently double-clicking
reverses movement of the falcon wing door. For
example if the door was opening, it closes, and
vice versa.
NOTE: Falcon wing doors are designed to proactively
detect obstacles that prevent the doors from moving
when an obstacle is detected.

1. Trunk
◦ Double-click to open or close the rear trunk.
◦ If equipped with a powered liftgate, double-click
to unlatch the rear trunk. You can also single-click
to stop the liftgate when it is moving.
◦ Hold the button down for one to two seconds to
open the charge port door.
2. Lock/Unlock All
◦ Single-click to lock all doors and rear trunk.
Hazard warning lights flash once.
NOTE: If a door or the rear trunk is open, hazard
warning lights flash three times and doors do not
lock. But you can enable a single-click to both
close all doors (and rear trunk) and lock them, by
turning on the Close All with Key Fob setting
(touch Controls > Locks > Close All with Key
Fob). By default, this setting is turned off and you
must triple-click the button to close and lock all
doors.
◦ Double-click to unlock. Hazard warning lights flash
twice.
NOTE: If Automatic Doors is enabled (touch
Controls > Locks > Automatic Doors), doors
unlock and the driver's door opens as you
approach Model X. A subsequent double-click
opens the passenger front door.

WARNING: Model X falcon wing doors have
several sensors to detect the presence of an object
in the door's path. In most cases, when an object is
detected, the door stops moving. However, the
sensors are unable to detect all areas under all
circumstances, particularly when closing,
Therefore, you must monitor the movement of
falcon wing doors to ensure the door's path of
movement is free of obstacles, staying prepared at
all times to proactively intervene to stop the door
from contacting an object (including a person).
Failure to do so can cause serious damage or
bodily injury.
Once inside, power up Model X by pressing the brake
pedal within two minutes of pressing the unlock button
on the key fob (see Starting and Powering Off on page
73). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must press
the unlock button again, or place the key fob near the
card reader located in the lower half of the left wireless
phone charger, facing downward, on the center console.
When your key fob is detected, the two minute
authentication period restarts.
When approaching or leaving Model X carrying the key
fob, you do not need to point the key fob at Model X as
you press a button, but you must be within operating
range.
Radio equipment on a similar frequency can affect the
key. If this happens, move the key at least one foot
(30 cm) away from other electronic devices (phones,
laptops, etc.).
In the event that the key fob's battery is dead, you can
still use it. To unlock the vehicle, scan the key fob on the
card reader located on the driver's side door pillar (like
the key card).

Keys
CAUTION: Protect the key from impact, high
temperatures, and damage from liquids. Avoid
contact with solvents, waxes, and abrasive
cleaners.

Passive Locking and Unlocking
Locking and unlocking Model X with your key fob is
conveniently hands-free. Although you must be carrying
a paired key fob, there is no need to use it. Model X has
sensors around the vehicle that can recognize the
presence of a key fob within a range of approximately
six feet (two meters). Therefore, you can keep your key
fob in your pocket or purse and press the door handle to
unlock and extend the handle. When carrying your key
fob with you, you can also open the trunk without
having to use the key by pressing the liftgate's exterior
switch. If Walk-Away Door Lock is enabled, Model X
automatically locks when you exit and the key fob is no
longer in range (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 30).
Passive locking and unlocking is automatically enabled
when you pair your key fob to Model X.

To drive the vehicle, scan the key fob on the phone
charger.
1. Place it at the top of the left phone charger, against
the center divider.
2. Point the front of the key fob to the left.
3. Swipe downwards.

Although you can use the same key fob with multiple
vehicles, it can only be paired to one vehicle at a time.
To activate a paired key fob to a different vehicle, touch
the flat side onto the driver's side door pillar and click
any button on the key fob to confirm.
NOTE: For increased security, passive locking and
unlocking disables after being stationary for five minutes
while within vehicle range when the vehicle is not in use
(for example, you are standing outside your vehicle). In
this situation, you must shake or press a button on the
key fob to re-enable passive locking and unlocking.

Replacing the Key Fob Battery
Under normal use, the key fob has a battery that lasts
for up to one year, depending on key fob version and
selected vehicle settings. When the battery is low, a
message displays on the touchscreen.
To replace the key fob battery:
1. With the key fob placed button side down on a soft
surface, release the bottom cover, using a small flatbladed tool.

Instructions for changing the battery are provided in
Replacing the Key Fob Battery on page 24.
NOTE: You can use the same key fob with multiple
Model X vehicles provided you authenticate it (see
Managing Keys on page 25). However, key fob works
with only one Model X at a time. Therefore, to use a key
fob for a different Model X, touch its flat side against the
card reader on the driver's side door pillar.
NOTE: Model X supports up to four different key fobs.

page 31.
NOTE: See Cold Weather Best Practices on page 163 for
information on opening the doors in cold weather.
CAUTION: The front doors may not fully open or
close automatically when parked on a very steep
hill. Never rely on Model X to fully open or close
the doors for you when parked on a steep hill.
To close doors from the outside, you can:
• Manually push them shut.
• Single-click or triple-click the key fob's lock/unlock
button (if the Close All with Key Fob setting is on,
only a single click is needed to close all doors and
trunks—a triple-click is needed if the setting is off).
NOTE: Powered doors stop moving if an obstacle is
detected.
WARNING: Before allowing an automated feature
to open or close a front door (rather than doing so
manually), it is important to check that the area
around the door is free of obstacles (such as
people and objects). You must proactively monitor
the door's movement to ensure that it does not
contact a person or object. Failure to do so can
result in damage or serious injury.

Opening and Closing

You can also use the touchscreen popup to open and
close doors when inside Model X while the vehicle is in
Park or by touching Controls > Locks.
The driver's door automatically closes when you sit in
the driver's seat and press the brake pedal. You can also
close doors by simply pulling the handle toward you.
WARNING: Before pressing the brake pedal and
causing the driver's door to automatically close,
ensure that there are no body parts (hands, legs,
etc.) obstructing the path of the closing door.

Opening and Closing Falcon Wing
Doors
Model X has falcon wing doors that easily open and
close by pressing a button, using a key fob, using the
mobile app, or touching the associated icon on the
touchscreen. The falcon wing doors are equipped with
several sensors that detect the presence of people and
objects and, if an object is detected, the door stops
moving. Based on detected objects, the doors may
adjust their outward and upward movement in an
attempt to avoid contacting the object. For example, if
an object is detected above Model X, the door's
movement may extend further outward but lower,
whereas if an object (or person) is detected beside the
door, the door may extend outward much less.

27

Doors
WARNING: It is important to keep your hands clear
of the falcon wing door frames at all times.
Proactively check the door frame area prior to
closing, and monitor the movement of the door
during closing to ensure that it does not come into
contact with a person or object. Failure to do so
can result in damage or serious injury.
WARNING: Before opening or closing a falcon
wing door, it is important to check that the area
around the door is free of obstacles (people and
objects). Although the doors have many sensors, it
can not detect all objects at all times, particularly
when moving. At any given moment, there may be
areas near the door that are not in the detection
zone. Therefore, when opening or closing a falcon
wing door, you and your passengers must stand
away from the door as it is moving, while
proactively monitoring the door's movement and
being prepared to take corrective action at any
time. To stop a door from moving, single-click the
falcon wing door button on the key fob, press the
switch on the door or door pillar, or touch the
button on the touchscreen.

CAUTION: Remove accumulation of snow or ice
before opening a falcon wing door. Snow can get
inside Model X and ice can prevent the door from
opening. In situations where water or snow has
accumulated on the glass on top of the falcon
wing door, Tesla recommends using the
touchscreen or switch on the door pillar (instead
of the external door handle or key fob) to slowly
open the falcon wing door for the first few inches
(cm). Opening the falcon wing door slowly for the
first few inches (cm) mitigates the scenario of
water, snow, etc. from entering the vehicle.
To close a falcon wing door, press the button located on
the inside of the door. You can also use the key fob (see
Key Fob on page 22), use the switch on the door pillar
(illustrated above), or touch the associated door icon on
the touchscreen (Controls > Close).

To open a falcon wing door from outside Model X, press
the door handle or double-press the falcon wing door
button on the key fob (see Keys on page 22).
To open a falcon wing door from inside Model X, press
the switch located on the driver's side door pillar, or, on
the touchscreen, touch the associated door icon
(Controls > Locks):
NOTE: Falcon wing doors open only when Model X is
stationary.

If a falcon wing door or the front trunk is left open when
you attempt to shift out of Park, the touchscreen
displays a notification requiring you to confirm your
intent to drive. The falcon wing door automatically
closes when your driving speed reaches 10 mph
(16 km/h). In addition, your vehicle speed is limited if
you choose to keep the front trunk open while driving. It
is your responsibility to ensure doors and trunks are
properly closed before driving.
NOTE: To prevent children from opening falcon wing
doors using the interior switch, turn on child-protection
locks using the touchscreen (Controls > Locks > Child
Locks). See Child Locks on page 31.

NOTE: If Model X is locked, using the switch (illustrated
above) the first time unlocks the associated door. Using
it a second time opens it.

NOTE: You can configure Model X to open the falcon
wing doors to a lower height setting by using the
touchscreen (Controls > Locks > Falcon Door Height).
NOTE: If a falcon wing door detects an obstacle while
closing, it reverses a few inches before it stops moving.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Doors
WARNING: Whenever a front door is partially open
(approximately 20°) as you are opening or closing
the associated falcon wing door, you MUST keep
your hands (or any object) away from the opening
edge of the front door. When a falcon wing door
passes by a partially opened front door, the
distance between the two doors is very narrow.
Objects, such as hands or fingers, placed in this
area, are not detected by sensors and can
therefore become pinched between the doors. To
avoid bodily injury, it is a good practice to keep
your hands away from the front door whenever
you are opening or closing a falcon wing door.

WARNING: Before overriding a falcon wing door's
default opening height, visually inspect the area to
ensure adequate clearance between the door and
the detected object.
WARNING: Applying adhesive products such as
wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc. on the outside
of the falcon wing doors can affect the sensors’
ability to detect obstacles properly.

Calibration
If the falcon wing doors lose calibration, the main
Controls window on the touchscreen displays a
Calibration Required message. To calibrate the doors,
first ensure that both doors have plenty of space to
open and close and are clear of passengers, objects, etc.
Touch Controls > Service > Calibrate Doors, and follow
the instructions on the touchscreen. During calibration,
the lower door opens all the way out (requiring extra
space on the side of Model X), the upper door moves all
the way down, and then the lower door closes.

Opening Interior Doors with No
Power

CAUTION: In rainy weather, leaving a falcon wing
open while opening the liftgate can result in rain
water falling from the liftgate into the rear seating
area.

To open a front door in the unlikely situation when
Model X has no power, pull up the manual door release
located in front of the window switches.

WARNING: When opening or closing a falcon wing
door, it is important to proactively monitor the
movement of the door to ensure that it does not
come into contact with a person or object. Failure
to do so can cause serious damage or injury.

Obstacle Detection
A falcon wing door stops moving when one of its many
sensors detects an obstacle, or when the door senses
resistance because it has made contact with an object.
The touchscreen displays a warning. In these cases,
provided it is appropriate to continue opening or closing
the falcon wing door, you can override obstacle
detection by pressing and holding the switch located on
the door pillar, or touching and holding the associated
door icon on the touchscreen.
When Model X detects a low ceiling (for example, in a
garage), it opens the falcon wing doors (and trunk) to a
lower height, even if no obstacle is detected. You can
override this height and open the doors higher by
touching the associated door icon on the touchscreen
(Controls). The touchscreen displays a message asking
you if you always want to open the doors to the higher
height at this location, and saves your choice. The next
time you open the falcon wing doors at this location,
Model X opens them to the height you saved.

Opening and Closing

CAUTION: Manual door releases are designed to
be used only in situations when Model X has no
power. When the vehicle has power, use the button
located at the top of the interior door handle.
To open the falcon wing doors, carefully remove the
speaker grille from the door and pull the mechanical
release cable down and towards the front of the vehicle.
After the latch is released, manually lift up the door.

29

Doors
1. Carefully close the door latch using a pen,
screwdriver, or comparable tool (never use a finger or
body part and avoid damaging the paint); Model X
will detect this as though the door is closed.

2. Make sure Model X is unlocked, then press the
exterior door handle or pull the interior door handle
to reset the latch and extend the pop actuator.

Front Door Reset
Since your Model X does not have traditional door
handles that you can pull from the outside, it is
equipped with pop actuators (sometimes referred to as
"ice breakers") that are used to assist in opening the
front doors in cases where resistance is detected, such
as ice buildup in cold weather. The pop actuator is
located just above the front door latch and extends as
necessary to open the front door. Once the front door
opens slightly, the pop actuator gently retracts back into
the door.

3. As the pop actuator extends out from the door,
quickly extract the object.
WARNING: The pop actuator will attempt to
retract back into the door almost immediately
after the door handle is pressed or pulled. The
pop actuator retracts gently, but will not release
automatically if something gets caught.
WARNING: As with all mechanical and moving
parts on the vehicle, never put body parts in, or
near, moving components. Make sure children are
monitored when opening and closing doors.
Interacting with moving components, including the
pop actuator, can cause serious damage or bodily
injury.

Interior Locking and Unlocking
While sitting inside Model X, you can lock and unlock all
doors and trunks by touching the lock icon in Controls.
The icon changes to indicate whether
doors are locked or unlocked.

Walk-Away Door Lock

Rear Trunk
Opening
To open the rear trunk, ensure Model X is in Park, then
do one of the following:
• Touch Controls > Trunk on the touchscreen.
• Double-click the rear trunk button on the key fob.
• Touch the rear trunk button on the mobile app.
• Press the switch located under the liftgate's exterior
handle (a valid key must be detected).
CAUTION: Before opening the liftgate in an
enclosed area (such as a garage), ensure the
opening height of the liftgate is properly adjusted
to avoid low-hanging ceilings or objects (see
Adjusting Liftgate Opening Height on page 34).
Model X must be unlocked or detect a key before you
can use the switch to open the liftgate.

NOTE: In emergency situations, you can override an
open or close command by grasping the liftgate to stop
it in place.
If Model X detects a low ceiling (for example, in a
garage), it opens the liftgate (and falcon wing doors) to
a lower height, even if no obstacle is detected. You can
override this height by manually lifting it higher. When
doing so, the touchscreen prompts you to choose if you
always want the trunk to open to this higher position at
this location, and saves your choice. If you choose to do
so, the next time you open the liftgate at this location,
Model X opens it to the saved height.
WARNING: Before opening or closing the liftgate,
check the surrounding area (for people and
objects). Although the liftgate can detect
obstacles, it cannot detect all objects at all times.
Do not rely on the liftgate to sense an obstruction
when opening or closing. You must proactively
monitor the liftgate to ensure that it does not
come into contact with a person or object. Failure
to do so may result in damage or injury.

Adjusting Liftgate Opening Height
You can adjust the opening height of the liftgate to
make it easier to reach or to avoid low-hanging ceilings
or objects (for example, a garage door or light):
1. Open the trunk, then manually lower or raise the
liftgate to the desired opening height.
2. Press and hold the button on the underside of the
liftgate for three seconds until you hear a
confirmation chime.

The instrument panel informs you when a door or trunk
is open.
To stop a liftgate while it is moving, single-click the rear
trunk button on the key fob. Then, when you doubleclick the rear trunk button, it moves again, but in the
opposite direction (provided it was not almost entirely
open or closed when you stopped it). For example, if
you single-click to stop the liftgate while opening, when
you double-click, it closes.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Front and Rear Seats
WARNING: Riding in a moving vehicle with the
seat back reclined can result in serious injuries in a
collision, as you could slide under the lap belt or
be propelled into the seat belt. Ensure your seat
back is reclined no more than 30 degrees when
the vehicle is moving.

Calibrating Seats
(If equipped) You can calibrate the driver seat. This is
useful if you find your seat range limited or your driver
profile does not automatically adjust the seat for you.
Navigate to Controls > Service > Driver Seat, Steering &
Mirrors Calibration and follow the instructions on the
touchscreen.

Folding Second Row Seats (Bench)
The second row seat backs on bench seats can be
folded fully forward so they lay flat and maximize cargo
space. Pull up the mechanical lever located on the side
of each outboard seat (the same lever you use to recline
the seats, as described previously), then push the seat
back fully forward. The bench seats have a 60/40 split—
therefore, the adjustment lever on the left side folds the
seat backs for both the left and center seats, whereas
the lever on the right folds the rightmost seat back only.

WARNING: Ensure nothing is behind or
underneath the driver seat during calibration.
Failure to do so may cause serious injury.

Adjusting Second Row Seats
(Bench)
Second row bench seats can accommodate up to three
passengers. Use the mechanical adjustment lever
located at the side of each outboard seating position to
adjust the seat backs. A bench seat is split 60/40 so the
adjustment lever on the left side moves the seat backs
for both the left and center seats, whereas the lever on
the right side moves the rightmost seat back only. While
pulling and holding the lever, move the seat back to the
desired position, and then release the lever. When
returning a seat back to its upright position, try moving
it forward or back to ensure it is securely latched into
position.

NOTE: Before folding seats fully forward, remove any

and moves the seats forward and can squeeze an
occupant. Do not rely on Model X to recognize or
accommodate seated occupants while using this
button.

• If a front seat is positioned such that the second row
seat will collide with it during an easy entry
operation, it automatically moves forward enough to
accommodate the forward position of the second
row monopost seat.
• When an outboard seat tilts forward after pressing
the button, its backrest resets to the forward position
and may need to be re-adjusted for comfort.
• Forward movement of the second row monopost
seats cancels if an occupant adjusts a second row

Seat Covers
WARNING: Do not use seat covers in Model X.
Doing so could restrict deployment of the seatmounted side air bags if a collision occurs. Seat
covers can also interfere with the occupant
detection system that is used to determine the
status of the passenger front airbag.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Seat Belts
Wearing Seat Belts
Using seat belts and child safety seats is the most
effective way to protect occupants if a collision occurs.
Therefore, wearing a seat belt is required by law in most
jurisdictions.

3. Insert the latch plate into the buckle and press
together until you hear a click indicating it is locked
in place.

Both the driver and passenger seats are equipped with
three-point inertia reel seat belts. Inertia reel belts are
automatically tensioned to allow occupants to move
comfortably during normal driving conditions. To
securely hold child safety seats, all passenger seating
positions are equipped with an automatic locking
retractor (ALR) feature that, by fully extracting the seat
belt (beyond the length needed for a typical adult
occupant), locks the belt into place until the seat belt is
unbuckled.
The seat belt reel automatically locks to prevent
movement of occupants if Model X experiences a force
associated with hard acceleration, braking, cornering, or
an impact in a collision.

Seat Belt Reminders
The seat belt reminder on the instrument
panel alerts you if a seat belt for an
occupied driver or passenger seat is
unbuckled. If all occupants are buckled up
and the reminder stays on, re-buckle seat
belts to ensure they are correctly latched.
Also remove any heavy objects (such as a
briefcase) from an unoccupied seat. If the
reminder light continues to stay on,
contact Tesla.
You can temporarily disable a seat belt reminder
associated with a rear seating position. This is useful
when you are carrying an object in a rear seat that
triggers the seat belt reminder alert. To disable the
reminder, touch the associated seat on the seat belt
reminder popup message that displays on the
touchscreen when a seat belt reminder is active. When a
reminder is disabled, the seat belt reminder icon is
replaced by a seat icon, for the current drive only. Touch
the seat again to re-enable the reminder.

4. Pull the belt to check that it is securely fastened.
5. Pull the diagonal part of the belt toward the reel to
remove excess slack.

To Adjust the Shoulder Anchor
Height
Model X is equipped with an adjustable shoulder anchor
for each front seat to ensure that the seat belt is
positioned correctly. The seat belt should lay flat across
the mid-point of your collar bone while in the correct
driving position (see Correct Driving Position on page
40). Adjust the height of the shoulder anchor if the seat
belt is not positioned correctly:
1. Press and hold the button on the shoulder anchor to
release the locking mechanism.
2. While holding the button, move the shoulder anchor
up or down, as necessary, to correctly position the
seat belt.

WARNING: Seat belts must be worn by passengers
in all seating positions. Do not disable a seat belt
reminder when the seating position is occupied by
a passenger.

To Fasten a Belt
1. Ensure correct positioning of the seat (see Correct
Driving Position on page 40).

3. Release the button on the shoulder anchor so that it
locks into position.

2. Draw the belt out smoothly, ensuring the belt lays flat
across the pelvis, chest and mid-point of your collar
bone, between the neck and shoulder.

4. Without pressing the button, pull on the seat belt
webbing and attempt to move the shoulder anchor
downward to check that it is locked into position.

Seating and Safety Restraints

45

Seat Belts
WARNING: Ensure that the seat belt is positioned
correctly and that the shoulder anchor is locked
into position before driving. Riding in a moving
vehicle with the seat belt positioned incorrectly or
with the shoulder anchor not locked into position
can reduce the effectiveness of the seat belt in a
collision.

The second row outboard seats are equipped with
shoulder pre-tensioners to retract the seat belt webbing
to reduce forward movement of the occupant.

To Release a Belt
Hold the belt near the buckle to prevent the belt from
retracting too quickly, then press the button on the
buckle. The belt retracts automatically. Ensure there is
no obstruction that prevents the belt from fully
retracting. The belt should not hang loose. If a seat belt
does not fully retract, contact Tesla.

Wearing Seat Belts When Pregnant
Do not put the lap or shoulder sections of the seat belt
over the abdominal area. Wear the lap section of the
belt as low as possible across the hips, not the waist.
Position the shoulder portion of the belt between the
breasts and to the side of the abdomen. Consult your
doctor for specific guidance.

If the pre-tensioners and airbags did not activate in an
impact, this does not mean they malfunctioned. It
usually means that the strength or type of force needed
to activate them was not present.
WARNING: Once the seat belt pre-tensioners have
been activated, they must be replaced. After any
collision, have the airbags, seat belt pre-tensioners
and any associated components checked and, if
necessary, replaced.

Testing Seat Belts
To confirm that seat belts are operating correctly,
perform these three simple checks on each seat belt.
1. With the seat belt fastened, give the webbing nearest
the buckle a quick pull. The buckle should remain
securely locked.
2. With the belt unfastened, unreel the webbing to its
limit. Check that unreeling is free from snags, and
visually check the webbing for wear. Allow the
webbing to retract, checking that retraction is
smooth and complete.
3. With the webbing half unreeled, hold the tongue
plate and pull forward quickly. The mechanism should
lock automatically and prevent further unreeling.
WARNING: Never place anything between you and
the seat belt to cushion the impact in the event of
a collision.

Seat Belt Pre-tensioners
The front seat belts are equipped with pre‑tensioners
that work in conjunction with the airbags in a severe
frontal collision. The pre‑tensioners automatically retract
both the seat belt lower anchor and the upper shoulder
webbing, reducing slack in both the lap and diagonal
portions of the belts, resulting in reduced forward
movement of the occupant.

46

If a seat belt fails any of these tests, contact Tesla
immediately.
For information about cleaning seat belts, see Seat Belts
on page 201.

Seat Belt Warnings
WARNING: Seat belts should be worn by all
occupants at all times, even if driving for a very
short distance. Failure to do so increases the risk
of injury or death if a collision occurs.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Seat Belts
WARNING: Secure small children in a suitable child
safety seat as described in the Child Safety Seat
topic. Always follow the child safety seat
manufacturer's instructions when installing.
WARNING: Ensure that all seat belts are worn
correctly. An improperly worn seat belt increases
the risk of injury or death if a collision occurs.
WARNING: Do not wear seat belts over hard,
fragile or sharp items in clothing, such as pens,
keys, eyeglasses, etc. The pressure from the seat
belt on such items can cause injury.
WARNING: Seat belts should not be worn with any
part of the strap twisted.
WARNING: Each seat belt assembly must be used
by one occupant only. It is dangerous to put a seat
belt around a child being carried on an occupant’s
lap.
WARNING: Seat belts that have been worn in a
collision must be inspected or replaced by Tesla,
even if damage to the assembly is not obvious.
WARNING: Seat belts that show signs of wear
(such as fraying), or have been cut or damaged in
any way, must be replaced by Tesla.
WARNING: Avoid contaminating a seat belt’s
components with any chemicals, liquids, grit, dirt
or cleaning products. If a seat belt fails to retract
or latch into the buckle, it must be replaced
immediately. Contact Tesla.
WARNING: Do not make modifications or
additions that can prevent a seat belt mechanism
from taking up slack, or that can prevent a seat
belt from being adjusted to remove slack. A slack
belt greatly reduces occupant protection.
WARNING: Do not make modifications that can
interfere with the operation of a seat belt, or that
can cause a seat belt to become inoperable.
WARNING: Do not use after market comfort and
convenience products that attach to the seat belts.
WARNING: When seat belts are not in use, they
should be fully retracted and not hanging loose. If
a seat belt does not fully retract, contact Tesla.
WARNING: The seat belt system has no user
serviceable parts and may contain pyrotechnics.
Do not disassemble, remove, or replace
components.

Child Safety Seats
Guidelines for Seating Children
Your Model X seat belts are designed for adults and larger children. You must restrain infants and small children in
rear seats only, and you must use a suitable child safety seat appropriate for the child’s age, weight, and size.
Never use child safety seats in the front passenger seat.
WARNING: Never seat a child in the front passenger seat, even if using a child safety seat.
WARNING: Never seat a child on a seat with an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front of it. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to
the child can occur.
WARNING: For vehicles with third row seats, when a child is seated in a second row monopost seat, the setting
for the button that moves a second row outboard seat forward for easy access into the third row should be
OFF (touch Controls > Seats > Easy Entry). This ensures that you need to manually hold the button to move
the seat, preventing a child seated in the second row from being pushed against the corresponding front seat.
See Adjusting Second Row Seats (Monopost) on page 42.
Refer to the following label located on the sun visors.
NOTE: The image(s) shown below are representative only and may not be identical to the labels in your vehicle.

Model X has an occupancy sensor in the front passenger seat that controls the passenger front airbag (see Airbags
on page 56).
The Passenger Airbag Off indicator displays on the touchscreen when the passenger front airbag is
OFF. When the passenger front airbag is OFF, it does not inflate when a collision occurs. This
indicator also displays when the seat is unoccupied. Before driving with a child seated on the front
passenger seat, always double-check the status of the passenger front airbag to confirm that it is
OFF.
To protect an adult occupying the front passenger seat, always double-check the passenger front
airbag to confirm that it is ON.
WARNING: Always ensure that all Model X seats are locked in position before traveling. Failure to do so
increases the risk of injury. Pay attention to all warnings displayed on the touchscreen.
WARNING: Do not associate the Easy Entry setting with the driver's profile when a child is seated in a second
row seat. Doing so can cause the driver's seat to push against the child, especially when a child is seated in a
forward-facing child seat or booster seat. Do not rely on Model X to recognize or accommodate a child seated
in the second row seats while using this setting (see Driver Profiles on page 96).

Choosing a Child Safety Seat
All children age 12 and under should ride in the second and third row seats. Always use a child safety seat suitable
for a young child’s age and weight. The following table is based on child safety seat recommendations determined
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States (for more information, go to
www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/car-seats-and-booster-seats).

* Many child safety seats currently available allow children to ride rear-facing using the child safety seat’s integrated 5-point
harness for a longer period of time BASED UPON SPECIFIC HEIGHT AND WEIGHT LIMITS. Keep your child in a rear-facing seat
for as long as possible. CHECK THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS AND CAREFULLY FOLLOW ALL
INSTRUCTIONS.
** LATCH ("Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children") and ISOFIX are international standards for attachment points for child
safety seats in passenger cars that enable compliant child safety seats to be quickly and safely secured. The system has other
regional names including LUAS ("Lower Universal Anchorage System") or Canfix in Canada. It has also been called the "Universal
Child Safety Seat System" or UCSSS.
*** Subject to instructions provided by the child safety seat manufacturer.

WARNING: Laws that govern how and where children should be carried when traveling in a vehicle are subject
to change. It is the driver’s responsibility to keep up to date on, and comply with, all current regulations in the
region(s) where Model X is driven. To check the child passenger safety laws for states in the U.S., go to: http://
www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/childsafety_laws.html.
WARNING: Do not use LATCH anchors with child safety seats or booster seats that have an integral safety belt
where the combined weight of the child plus the child safety seat exceeds 65 lbs (29.5 kg).

Seating Larger Children
If a child is too large to fit into a child safety seat, but
too small to safely fit into the standard seat belts, use a
booster seat appropriate for the child’s age and size.
Carefully follow the manufacturer’s instructions to
secure the booster seat.

Installing Child Safety Seats
There are two general methods used to install child
safety seats:
• Seat belt retained - these seats are secured using the
vehicle’s seat belts.
• LATCH retained - these seats attach to anchor bars
built into the vehicle’s second row outboard seats.

Storage Areas

Check the child safety seat manufacturer’s instructions
and the table in this manual to determine which
installation method to use. Some child safety seats can
be installed using either method. Always follow the child
safety seat manufacturer’s instructions.

Installing Seat Belt Retained Child
Seats
First, make sure that the child safety seat is appropriate
for the weight, height, and age of the child.
Avoid dressing the child in bulky clothing and do not
place any objects between the child and the restraint
system.
Adjust harnesses for every child, every trip.

49

Child Safety Seats
To securely hold child safety seats, all passenger seating
positions are equipped with an automatic locking
retractor (ALR) feature that, by fully extracting the seat
belt (beyond the length needed for a typical adult
occupant), locks the belt into place until the seat belt is
unbuckled and the webbing is fully retracted. The ALR
mechanism operates as a ratchet, winding in slack and
preventing the seat belt from extending any further until
it has been completely rewound. When installing a child
safety seat with integrated restraints, engage the belt's
automatic locking retractor by pulling the seat belt
webbing until it is fully extended. The ALR system
engages only when the seat belt is at its maximum
extension point.

Installing LATCH (ISOFIX) Child
Seats
Lower LATCH anchors are provided in the second row
outboard seats. The anchors are located between the
seat's rear back rest and lower cushion. The exact
location of each anchor is identified by a child safety
seat identification button, illustrated below. The button
is located on the seat back, directly above its associated
anchor.
Bench Seats

The automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature is not
used for booster seats in which a large child is restrained
by the vehicle's seat belts directly, and therefore not
using a child safety seat's integrated restraints.
NOTE: An automatic locking retractor disengages only
when the seat belt is unbuckled and fully retracted. The
belt can then be worn as a normal belt, sliding freely in
and out and locking tight only in an emergency. Once
disengaged, the belt must be fully extended to reengage the locking mechanism whenever you install a
child safety seat.
Always follow the detailed instructions provided by the
child safety seat manufacturer. General guidelines are
provided below.
1. Place the child safety seat in Model X, and fully
extend the seat belt. Route and buckle the seat belt
in accordance with the child safety seat
manufacturer’s instructions.

Monopost Seats

2. Allow the seat belt to retract, and remove all slack in
the seat belt while firmly pushing the child safety
seat into the Model X seat.
3. If the seat belt retained child safety seat has an upper
tether, attach it to the back of the seat (see Attaching
Upper Tether Straps on page 52).

50

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Child Safety Seats

NOTE: To accommodate large rear-facing LATCH child
safety seats, you may need to move the seat in the full
rearward position, and move the corresponding front
seat forward to the mid-track position (up to 13 cm
forward of the rearmost position), raise the seat upward
(3 cm from its lowest position), and angle the seat back
to 15 degrees (or 10 degrees rearward from its forwardmost position).

In the second row, install LATCH child safety seats in the
outboard seating positions only. Use only a seat belt
retained seat in the center position.
NOTE: If Model X is equipped with two seats in the
second row, both seats support the use of LATCH child
safety seats.

WARNING: Do not associate the Easy Entry
setting with the driver's profile when a child is
seated in the second row. Doing so can cause the
driver's seat to push against the child, especially
when a child is seated in a forward-facing child
seat or booster seat. Do not rely on Model X to
recognize or accommodate a child seated in the
second row while using this setting (see Driver
Profiles on page 96).
Monopost Seats

NOTE: Second row outboard seats support the use of
upper tether straps (see Attaching Upper Tether Straps
on page 52).
WARNING: Before driving after installing a child
seat in the second row, ensure that a "seat
unlocked" warning does NOT display on the
touchscreen or instrument panel. This warning
indicates that the seat is unsafe for an occupant
because it was not returned to its safe, locked
position. If the touchscreen or instrument panel
displays the warning message, move the seat or
backrest slightly forward or backward until it locks
firmly into position and the message no longer
displays.
Bench Seats
NOTE: To accommodate large rear-facing LATCH child
safety seats, you may need to move the seat in the full
rearward position, and move the corresponding front
seat forward to the mid-track position (up to 13 cm
forward of the rearmost position), raise the seat upward
(3 cm from its lowest position), and angle the seat back
to 15 degrees (or 10 degrees rearward from its forwardmost position).

Seating and Safety Restraints

51

Child Safety Seats
WARNING: For vehicles with third row seats, when
a child is seated in a second row monopost seat,
the setting for the button that moves a second row
outboard seat forward for easy access into the
third row should be OFF (touch Controls > Seats >
Easy Entry). This ensures that you need to
manually hold the button to move the seat,
preventing a child seated in the second row from
being pushed against the corresponding front
seat. See Accessing Third Row Seats (if equipped)
on page 42.
To install a LATCH child safety seat, slide the safety seat
latches onto the anchor bars until they click into place.
Carefully read and follow the instructions provided by
the child safety seat manufacturer.
Bench Seats

Once installed, test the security of the installation before
seating a child. Attempt to twist the child safety seat
from side to side and try to pull it away from the seat,
then check to ensure the anchors remain securely in
place.
NOTE: Lower LATCH anchors should not be used with
child seats or booster seats that have an integrated
safety belt in situations where the combined weight of
the child plus the child safety seat is more than 65 lbs
(29.5 kg). In these situations, use the seat belt instead.

Attaching Upper Tether Straps
If an upper tether strap is provided, attach its hook to
the anchor point located on the back of the second and
third row (if equipped) seats.
Monopost Seats

NOTE: The location of anchor points may not be readily
visible but can be found by identifying a slice in the
seat's material.
WARNING: Tighten upper tether straps according
to the instructions provided by the manufacturer
of the child safety seat.
WARNING: USE ONLY SEAT BELT RETAINED
CHILD SAFETY SEATS IN THE CENTER SEATING
POSITION.
For dual-strap tethers, position a strap on each side of
the head restraint.

Child Safety Seats

Testing a Child Safety Seat
Before seating a child, always make sure the child safety
seat is not loose:

Single Strap - Second Row Bench Seats

1. Hold the child safety seat by the belt path and try to
slide the safety seat from side to side and front to
back.
2. If the seat moves more than one inch (2.5 cm), it is
too loose. Tighten the belt or reconnect the LATCH
retained child safety seat.
3. If you are unable to reduce slack, try a different seat
location or try another child safety seat.

Child Safety Seat Warnings
WARNING: Extreme hazard! Do not seat a child on
the front passenger seat even if you are using a
child safety seat. This seat has an airbag in front of
it. Although this airbag is disabled when Model X
detects a lightweight passenger, do not rely on
technology to protect your child.
WARNING: Child safety seats are designed to be
secured in vehicle seats by lap belts or the lap belt
portion of a lap-shoulder belt. A child could be
endangered in a crash if a child safety seat is not
properly secured in the vehicle.
WARNING: According to collision statistics,
children are safer when properly restrained in a
rear seating position than in the front passenger
seat.
Single Strap - Third Row Seats

WARNING: Do not use a forward-facing child
safety seat until your child weighs over 20 lbs (9
kg) and can sit independently. Up to the age of
two, a child's spine and neck are not sufficiently
developed to avoid injury in a frontal impact.
WARNING: Do not allow a baby or infant to be
held on a lap. All children should be restrained in
an appropriate child safety seat at all times.

54

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Child Safety Seats
WARNING: To ensure children are safely seated,
follow all instructions provided in this document
and by the manufacturer of the child safety seat.
WARNING: Children should ride in a rear-facing
child safety seat using the seat’s integrated 5point harness for as long as possible.
WARNING: Do not use seat belt extenders on a
seat belt that is being used to install a child safety
seat or booster seat.
WARNING: When seating larger children, make
sure the child's head is supported and the child’s
seat belt is properly adjusted and fastened. The
shoulder portion of the belt must be away from
the face and neck, and the lap portion must not be
over the stomach.
WARNING: Never attach two child safety seats to
one anchor point. In a collision, one anchor point
may be incapable of securing both seats.
WARNING: Child safety seat anchors are designed
to withstand only those loads imposed by a
correctly fitted child safety seat. Under no
circumstances are they to be used for adult seat
belts, harnesses, or for attaching other items or
equipment to the vehicle.
WARNING: Always check harnesses and tether
straps for damage and wear.
WARNING: Never leave a child unattended, even if
the child is secured in a child safety seat.
WARNING: Never use a child safety seat that has
been involved in a collision. Have the seat
inspected or replaced as described in the child
safety seat manufacturer’s instructions.

Airbags
Location of Airbags
Airbags are located in the approximate areas shown below. Airbag warning information is printed on the sun visors.
Model X is equipped with an airbag and lap/shoulder belt at both front seating positions. The airbag is a
supplemental restraint at those seating positions. All occupants, including the driver, should always wear their seat
belts whether or not an airbag is also provided at their seating position to minimize the risk of severe injury or death
in the event of a crash.

1. Knee airbags
2. Front airbags
3. Curtain airbags
4. Seat-mounted side airbags
5. Door-mounted airbags

How Airbags Work
Airbags inflate when sensors detect an impact that
exceeds deployment thresholds. These thresholds are
designed to predict the severity of a crash in time for
the airbags to help protect the vehicle's occupants.
Airbags inflate instantly with considerable force
56

accompanied by a loud noise. The inflated bag, together
with the seat belts, limits movement of occupants to
reduce the risk of injury.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Airbags
Front airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate in
rear collisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking
heavily or driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise,
front airbags may not inflate in all frontal collisions, such
as minor front collisions, underride collisions, or minor
impacts with narrow objects (such as posts or poles).
Significant superficial damage can occur to the vehicle
without the airbags inflating and, conversely, a relatively
small amount of structural damage can cause airbags to
inflate. Therefore, the external appearance of the vehicle
after a collision does not represent whether or not the
front airbags should have inflated.
WARNING: Before modifying Model X to
accommodate a person with disabilities in a way
that may affect the airbag system, contact Tesla.

• Curtain airbags: A curtain airbag on each side of
Model X in the front roof-rail help protect the head.
Curtain airbags on both the impacted and nonimpacted side of the vehicle will inflate if a severe
side impact occurs, a severe offset frontal impact
occurs, or if the vehicle rolls over.
• Door-mounted airbags: There is an airbag on each
side of Model X mounted in the trim on the falcon
wing doors. These are the same as the curtain airbags
in that they help protect the head and typically inflate
in the event of a severe side impact, a severe offset
frontal impact, or if the vehicle rolls over. The doormounted airbags on both the impacted and nonimpacted side of the vehicle will inflate.

Airbag Status Indicator

Types of Airbags

The status of the passenger front airbag displays on the
touchscreen:

Model X has the following types of airbags:
• Front airbags: The front airbags are designed to
reduce injuries if larger children or adults are riding in
the front seats. Follow all warnings and instructions
related to seating a child on the front passenger seat
(if permitted in your market region).
• Knee airbags: Knee airbags and the front airbags
work together. The knee airbags limit the forward
motion of the front seat occupants by restricting leg
movement, thereby positioning the occupants so that
the front airbags work more effectively. Whether or
not knee airbags deploy in a collision is partially
dependent on the track position of the associated
seat.
• Seat-mounted side airbags: A seat-mounted side
airbag in the front driver, front passenger and second
row outboard seats help protect the pelvis and the
thorax region of the torso. The seat-mounted side
airbags on both the impacted and non-impacted side
of the vehicle will inflate in the event of severe side
impact or severe offset frontal impact.

The Passenger Airbag Off indicator
displays on the touchscreen when the
passenger front airbag is OFF. When the
passenger front airbag is OFF, it does
not inflate when a collision occurs. This
indicator also displays when the seat is
unoccupied. When driving with a child
seat on the front passenger seat (if
permitted in your market region), always
double-check the status of the
passenger front airbag to confirm that it
is OFF.
To protect an adult occupying the front
passenger seat, ensure the passenger
front airbag is ON. When the passenger
airbag is ON, it may inflate when a
collision occurs.

Front Passenger Occupant Detection
Model X has an occupancy classification system (OCS) that controls the status of the passenger front airbag.
NOTE: The occupancy classification system (OCS) automatically detects when inflating the passenger front airbag
would be unnecessary or potentially harmful.
WARNING: Seating an infant in a rear-facing child restraint system on a seat equipped with an operational
airbag can cause serious injury or death.

*If the passenger airbag status indicator does not match the situation, do not use the seat. The passenger must ride in a different
seat. Contact Tesla Service.

NOTE: It takes approximately six seconds after you power on Model X for the occupant classification system (OCS)
to report accurate status of the front passenger airbag. As a result, when you first power on Model X, even in
situations when it should be OFF because the seat is occupied by a weight of 20 lbs (9 kg) or less, it will take the
touchscreen approximately six seconds to display the status, PASS AIRBAG OFF. If it fails to do so, contact Tesla
Service and do not seat a child in the front passenger seating position.
To make sure the sensing system can correctly detect occupancy status, eliminate the following:
• Objects lodged under the seat.
• Heavy objects sitting on the seat (briefcase, large purse).
• Objects wedged between the seat back and seat cushion.
• Cargo interfering with the seat.
• Aftermarket items attached to, or sitting on or between, the seat and occupant including but not limited to
covers, mats, blankets, etc.
These conditions can interfere with the occupancy sensor. If you have eliminated the above possibilities, and the
airbag status is still incorrect, ask passengers to ride in the rear seats and contact Tesla to have the airbag system
checked.
NOTE: The front passenger occupancy sensor affects the operation of the passenger front airbags only. The side
airbags are not affected.
WARNING: If the front passenger airbag is not turning on or off as expected based on the weight thresholds
previously described, contact Tesla immediately.
WARNING: Never seat a child in the front passenger seat. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the child can occur.

can be accurately classified, the passenger must:
• Wear a seat belt.

58

• Sit upright on the center of the seat cushion, with
shoulders resting against the seat back and legs
extended comfortably in front with feet on the floor.
See Examples of Correct and Incorrect Seating
Positions on page 60.See Examples of Correct and
Incorrect Seating Positions on page 59..
• Remain positioned on the seat cushion and not lift
their weight off the seat (for example, by pushing
their feet against the floor or pressing on the center
console or armrest to lift up).

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Airbags
• Never wear thick, wet, or bulky clothing (such as ski
wear or padded clothing).

Examples of Correct and Incorrect
Seating Positions

In addition to the items listed above, the following
situations can interfere with the accuracy of the
occupant classification system:

Correct seating position:

• Placing a radio transmitter (for example, a hunting
radio or walkie-talkie) on the front passenger seat.
• Placing an AC/DC inverter, or a device that is being
powered by the inverter (for example, a cell phone,
tablet, or computer) on the front passenger seat
cushion.
• Placing liquid (such as a bottled drink) or food
containers on a car seat when a child restraint system
is present.
• Incorrectly placing a child restraint system so that the
entire lower section is not positioned against the seat
cushion.
• Objects lodged under the seat or wedged between
the seat back and cushion.
• Heavy objects sitting on the seat (briefcase, large
purse).
• Cargo interfering with the seat.
• Aftermarket items attached to or placed between the
seat and the occupant, such as covers, mats,
blankets, etc.

Incorrect seating position - the passenger's feet must be
on the floor:

These conditions can interfere with the occupancy
sensor. If you have eliminated the above possibilities,
and the airbag status is still incorrect, instruct
passengers to ride in the rear seats and contact Tesla to
have the airbag system checked.
NOTE: Tesla follows NHTSA (National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration) recommendations that all
occupants age 12 and under must ride in the rear seating
positions.
NOTE: The front passenger occupancy sensor affects
the operation of the passenger front airbags only. The
side airbags are not affected.
WARNING: Failure to follow the above instructions
can adversely affect the Occupant Classification
System (OCS) which can cause serious injury or
death.
WARNING: If the front passenger airbag is not
turning on or off as expected, do not seat a
passenger in the front passenger seat. Contact
Tesla Service.

Incorrect seating position - the passenger must not slide
forward on the seat cushion:

WARNING: To ensure accuracy of the occupant
detection system, do not make any modifications
to the front passenger seat.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Airbags
After inflation, the airbags deflate to provide a gradual
cushioning effect for the occupants and to ensure the
driver’s forward vision is not obscured.
If airbags have inflated, or if your vehicle has been in a
collision, always have the airbags, seat belt pretensioners and any associated components checked
and, if necessary, replaced by Tesla.
In a collision, in addition to the airbags inflating:
• Doors and liftgate unlock.
• Hazard warning lights turn on.
• Interior lights turn on.
• High voltage is disabled. To restore high voltage
power, use the touchscreen to manually power off
Model X (see Powering Off on page 73), then press
the brake to power it back on again.

Incorrect seating position - the passenger must not
recline the backrest to a laying down position when the
vehicle is moving:

NOTE: Depending on the nature of the impact and the
forces involved, doors may not unlock in a collision
and/or damage may prevent them from opening. In such
cases, the door may need to be opened using the
interior manual release, or other means of extrication
(for example, exiting through another door, breaking the
window, etc.).

Airbag Warning Indicator
The airbag indicator on the touchscreen
remains lit if the airbag system is
malfunctioning. The only time this indicator
should light up is briefly when Model X first
powers up, in which case it turns off within
a few seconds. If it remains lit, contact
Tesla immediately and do not drive.

Airbag Warnings
WARNING: All occupants, including the driver,
should always wear their seat belts, whether or not
an airbag is also provided at their seating position,
to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the
event of a collision.
WARNING: Front seat occupants should not place
their arms over the airbag module, as an inflating
airbag can cause fractures or other injuries.
WARNING: Do not use seat covers on Model X.
Doing so could restrict deployment of the seatmounted side air bags if a collision occurs. It can
also reduce the accuracy of the occupant
detection system, if equipped.

Inflation Effects
WARNING: When airbags inflate, a fine powder is
released. This powder can irritate the skin and
should be thoroughly flushed from the eyes and
from any cuts or abrasions.

Seating and Safety Restraints

61

Airbags
WARNING: Airbags inflate with considerable
speed and force, which can cause injury. To limit
injuries, ensure that occupants are wearing seat
belts and are correctly seated, with the seat
positioned as far back as possible. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
recommends a minimum distance of 10" (25 cm)
between an occupant’s chest and an airbag.
WARNING: Children should not be seated on the
front passenger seat. Follow all regulations in your
region for the appropriate way to seat a child
based on the child's weight, size, and age. The
safest place to seat infants and young children is in
a rear seating position. Seating an infant or child
on a seat equipped with an operational front
airbag can cause serious injury or death.
WARNING: Do not use a rear-facing child restraint
system on a seat with an operational airbag in
front of it. Doing so can cause injury or death if the
airbag inflates.
WARNING: To ensure correct inflation of the side
airbags, maintain an unobstructed gap between an
occupant’s torso and the side of Model X.
WARNING: Passengers shouldn't lean their heads
against doors. Doing so can cause injury if a
curtain airbag inflates.
WARNING: Do not allow passengers to obstruct
the operation of an airbag by placing feet, knees
or any other part of the body on or near an airbag.
WARNING: Do not attach or place objects on or
near the front airbags, the side of the front seats,
the headliner at the side of the vehicle, or any
other airbag cover that could interfere with
inflation of an airbag. Objects can cause serious
injury if the vehicle is in a collision severe enough
to cause the airbag to inflate.
WARNING: Following inflation, some airbag
components are hot. Do not touch until they have
cooled.

to operate the device (for example, a remotecontrolled garage door). This mode is the most
commonly used transmit mode for HomeLink
devices.
• D-Mode or UR-Mode: Use D-Mode or UR-Mode if the
RF device does not have a remote control, and the
receiver has a "Learn" button (may also be called
"Program" or "Smart"). D-Mode and UR-Mode
function similarly in that Model X communicates
directly with the device's receiver as opposed to the
remote control.
NOTE: D-Mode is used primarily in North America
whereas UR-Mode is popular in Europe, the Middle
East, and Asia. To determine the mode your device is
compatible with, contact HomeLink
(www.homelink.com or call 1-800-355-3515).

are unsuccessful after multiple attempts of using long
presses, try repeated presses of one second each.

D-Mode and UR-Mode
In D-Mode and UR-Mode, the device’s receiver learns
Model X. The touchscreen instructs you to press the
"Learn" button (may also be called "Program" or
"Smart") on the device's receiver. If this does not work,
refer to the following guidelines:
• Park Model X with its bumper as close as possible to
the garage door, gate, etc. that you are trying to
program.
• Make sure you are pressing the receiver's Learn/
Program/Smart button. For instructions on how to
put the receiver into learning mode, refer to the
product details provided with your RF device that
you are trying to program.
• If you see a screen called "Train the receiver" while

time-sensitive step. After pressing the Learn/
Program/Smart button on the device's remote
control or receiver, you only have approximately 30
seconds to return to your vehicle, press Continue,
then press the trained HomeLink device name twice.
Consider having someone assist you with this step.
• Most devices stay in learning mode for only three to
five minutes. Immediately after pressing the device's
Learn/Program/Smart button, follow the instructions
displayed on the vehicle's touchscreen.
For additional assistance or compatibility questions,
contact HomeLink (www.homelink.com or call

conditions. If you change to a different setting, lights
always revert to Auto on your next drive.
Touch one of these options to change and retain the
exterior light setting until adjusted again or the next
time you drive:
• Off: Exterior lights turn off. When driving, daytime
running lights may remain on based on regulations in
various market regions.
• Parking: Parking lights, side marker lights, tail lights
and license plate lights turn on.
• On: Low beam headlights, side marker lights, parking
lights, tail lights, and license plate lights turn on.
CAUTION: Ensure the headlights and rear lights
are on during low visibility conditions (for example,
when it is dark, foggy, snowy, or the road is wet,
etc.). The rear tail lights are off while daytime
running lights are on. Failure to do so can cause
damage or serious injury.
NOTE: To comply with local traffic regulations when
crossing from a left-hand traffic region to a right-hand
traffic region, and vice versa, headlights should be
adjusted. If you plan to drive to a region that requires
headlights to be adjusted, schedule a service
appointment using the mobile app.

The front fog indicator displays on the
instrument panel whenever the optional
front fog lights are on.

NOTE: Depending on the market region and vehicle
options, your vehicle may not be equipped with front
and/or rear fog lights.
Dome Lights

Auto, all interior dome lights turn on when you unlock
Model X, open a door upon exiting, or shift into Park.
NOTE: You can also manually turn an individual dome
light on or off by pressing its lens. If you turn a dome
light on, it turns off when Model X powers off. If Model X
was already powered off when you manually turned the
light on, it turns off after 60 minutes.
Ambient Lights
When enabled, interior ambient lights turn on whenever
the headlights are on.
Headlights after Exit
If you turn on Headlights after Exit, the exterior lights
remain on for one minute after you stop driving and park
Model X in low lighting conditions. See Headlights After
Exit on page 83.

High Beam Headlights

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Lights
High beams are temporarily turned off
because Auto High Beam is operating and
light is detected in front of Model X. When
light is no longer detected, high beam
headlights automatically turn back on.
WARNING: Auto High Beam is a convenience only
and is subject to limitations. It is the driver's
responsibility to make sure that headlights are
always appropriately adjusted for weather
conditions and driving circumstances.

Rear Reading Lights

Auto High Beam (if equipped)
The high beam headlights can automatically switch to
low beam when there is light detected in front of
Model X (for example, from an oncoming vehicle). To
turn this feature on or off, touch Controls > Lights >
Auto High Beam. Your chosen setting is retained until
you manually change it.
NOTE: When you touch or press the high beam
headlight button on the left side of the steering yoke (or
steering wheel), the touchscreen displays an abbreviated
lights menu to provide quick access to control
headlights, fog lights (if equipped), and the Auto High
Beam setting. Use the touchscreen to choose options
from this menu.
NOTE: Auto High Beam is automatically enabled when
Autosteer is engaged. To switch to low beam headlights,
press the high beam headlight button on the steering
yoke (or steering wheel). Auto High Beam is re-enabled
every time Autosteer is activated.
The following indicator lights are visible on the
instrument panel to show the status of the headlights:
Low beam headlights are on.

High beam headlights are on. Illuminates
when high beams are on but the Auto High
Beam setting is turned off or if the Auto
High Beam setting is turned on but is
temporarily unavailable.
High beams are currently turned on, and
Auto High Beam is ready to turn off the
high beams if light is detected in front of
Model X.

Driving

Model X is equipped with a reading light on each side of
the rear seats, located above the door and next to the
coat hangers (see Coat Hangers on page 39). To turn a
reading light on or off, press its lens. If you leave a
reading light turned on, it automatically turns off when
Model X powers off.

Headlights After Exit
When you stop driving and park Model X in low lighting
conditions, exterior lights temporarily remain
illuminated. They automatically turn off after one minute
or when you lock Model X whichever comes first.
To turn this feature on and off, touch Controls > Lights >
Headlights After Exit. When Headlights After Exit is off,
the headlights turn off immediately when you engage
Park and open a door.

Adaptive Front Lighting System
(AFS)
If equipped, the Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS)
automatically adjusts the beam of the headlights to
improve your driving view. Electric sensors measure
driving speed, steering angle and yaw (the rotation of
the car around the vertical axis) to determine the
optimum position of the headlights based on current
driving conditions. For example, to improve visibility
while driving on winding roads at night, the AFS casts
the beam in the direction of the curve. When low beam
headlights are turned on and when driving at lower
speeds, AFS improves lateral illumination to increase the
visibility of pedestrians and curbs, and to improve
visibility when turning at a dark intersection, into a
driveway, or when making a u-turn.
The Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS) operates
whenever headlights are on. If Model X isn't moving, or is
moving in reverse, the adaptive headlights do not
activate. This prevents the headlights from inadvertently
blinding other drivers.

83

Lights
If the AFS fails, the instrument panel
displays an alert. Contact Tesla Service.

Hazard Warning Flashers
To turn on the hazard warning flashers, press the button
on the drive mode selector located at the front of the
center console. All turn signals flash. Press again to turn
off.

Turn Signals
To engage a turn signal, press the corresponding arrow
button on the left side of the steering yoke (or steering
wheel). A turn signal cancels based on the angle of the
steering yoke (or steering wheel) (for example, you
finish making a turn). You can also cancel a turn signal
by pressing the turn signal button a second time.
If Controls > Lights > Automatic Turn Signals is set to
Auto Cancel, turn signals cancel automatically when
Model X detects completion of a maneuver such as a
merge, lane change, or a fork in the roadway. You can
override automatic cancellation at any time (for
example, you want the turn signal to remain on because
you are making more than one lane change). To override,
engage the turn signal by pressing and momentarily
holding the turn signal button (instead of just pressing).
Then, when the first maneuver is complete, the turn
signal remains on. If Automatic Turn Signals is set to Off,
you must cancel the turn signal manually by pressing the
turn signal button after maneuvers such as a merge, lane
change, or fork in the roadway.

NOTE: Hazard warning flashers operate even without a
key nearby.

Condensation in Head or Tail Lights
Due to weather changes, humidity levels, or recent
exposure to water (such as a car wash), condensation
may occasionally accumulate in your vehicle’s head or
tail lights. This is normal— as the weather gets warmer
and humidity decreases, condensation often disappears
on its own. If you notice water buildup within the
exterior lenses, or if the condensation affects the
visibility of the exterior lights, contact Tesla Service.

When a turn signal is operating,
the corresponding indicator lights
up on the instrument panel and
you can hear a clicking sound.

Wipers and Washers
You can access wiper settings by touching the wiper
button on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) or
touching Controls > Wipers.
Press the wiper button on the steering yoke (or steering
wheel) to wipe the windshield.
Press and hold the wiper button to spray washer fluid
onto the windshield. After releasing the button, the
wipers perform two additional wipes then, depending on
vehicle and environmental conditions, a third wipe a few
seconds later. You can also press and hold the wiper
button for a continuous spray of washer fluid—the
wipers perform the wipes after you release.
Whenever you press the wiper button, the instrument
panel displays the wiper menu, allowing you to adjust
wiper settings. Roll the left scroll button on the steering
yoke (or steering wheel) up or down to choose your
desired setting.

NOTE: Autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control
require wipers to be set to Auto. This setting is
automatic and you cannot change it.
NOTE: The Auto setting is currently in BETA. If
uncertain about using the Auto setting while in the
BETA phase, Tesla recommends operating the
wipers manually, as necessary.
◦ I - Intermittent, slow.
◦ II - Intermittent, fast.
◦ III - Continuous, slow.
◦ IIII - Continuous, fast.
NOTE: If you choose Auto and the ability to detect
liquid on the windshield becomes unavailable, the
wiper setting reverts to the most recently used
manual setting. If a manual setting cannot be
determined, the wipers turn off.
NOTE: You can also adjust the windshield wiper
speed and frequency using voice commands (see
Voice Commands on page 20).
CAUTION: To avoid the risk of damaging the
wipers, do not leave the wipers set to Auto
when washing Model X.
Periodically check and clean the edge of the wiper
blades. If a blade is damaged, replace it immediately. For
details on checking and replacing wiper blades, see
Windshield Wiper Blades, Jets and Fluid on page 203.
CAUTION: To avoid damaging the hood, ensure
that the hood is fully closed before activating the
windshield wipers.
CAUTION: Remove ice from the windshield before
turning the wipers on. Ice has sharp edges that can
damage the rubber on the wiper blades.
CAUTION: In harsh climates, ensure that the wiper
blades are not frozen or adhered to the windshield.

1. Turn the wipers off.
2. Choose how you want the wipers to operate:
◦ Auto - Model X detects whether or not it is raining.
When liquid is detected on the windshield,
Model X determines the optimal frequency of the
wipers. If Model X does not detect liquid on the
windshield, the wipers do not operate.

Braking and Stopping
Braking Systems
WARNING: Properly functioning braking systems
are critical to ensure safety. If you experience a
problem with the brake pedal, brake calipers, or
any component of a Model X braking system,
contact Tesla immediately.
Model X has an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that
prevents the wheels from locking when you apply
maximum brake pressure. This improves steering control
during heavy braking in most road conditions.
During emergency braking conditions, the ABS
constantly monitors the speed of each wheel and varies
the brake pressure according to the grip available.
The alteration of brake pressure can be felt as a pulsing
sensation through the brake pedal. This demonstrates
that the ABS is operating and is not a cause for concern.
Keep firm and steady pressure on the brake pedal while
experiencing the pulsing.
The ABS indicator briefly flashes amber on
the instrument panel when you first start
Model X. If this indicator lights up at any
other time, an ABS fault has occurred and
the ABS is not operating. Contact Tesla.
The braking system remains fully
operational and is not affected by an ABS
failure. However, braking distances may
increase. Drive cautiously and avoid heavy
braking.
If the instrument panel displays this red
brake indicator at any time other than
briefly when you first start Model X, a
brake system fault is detected, or the level
of the brake fluid is low. Contact Tesla
immediately. Apply steady pressure and
keep the brakes firm to bring the vehicle to
a stop when safe to do so.
The instrument panel displays this amber
brake indicator if a brake booster fault is
detected. Apply steady pressure and keep
the brakes firm to stop the vehicle when
safety permits. Hydraulic Boost
Compensation will be active (see Hydraulic
Boost Compensation on page 87).

Emergency Braking

If an alternative method is needed to bring the vehicle to
a stop, press and hold the Park button on the
touchscreen's drive mode strip to apply the brakes and
remove drive torque while the button is held. Touch
Controls to display the drive mode strip.
WARNING: Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so
interrupts operation of the ABS and can increase
braking distance.
WARNING: Always maintain a safe distance from
the vehicle in front of you and be aware of
hazardous driving conditions. While the ABS can
improve stopping distance, it cannot overcome the
laws of physics. It also does not prevent the
danger of hydroplaning (where a layer of water
prevents direct contact between the tires and the
road).
CAUTION: Automatic Emergency Braking (see
Automatic Emergency Braking on page 146) may
intervene to automatically brake in situations
where a collision is considered imminent.
Automatic Emergency Braking is not designed to
prevent a collision. At best, it can minimize the
impact of a frontal collision by attempting to
reduce your driving speed. Depending on
Automatic Emergency Braking to avoid a collision
can result in serious injury or death.
CAUTION: In emergency situations, if the brakes
are not functioning properly, press and hold the
Park button on the center console or touchscreen
to bring Model X to a stop. Do not use this method
to stop the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.

Dynamic Brake Lights (if equipped)
If you are driving over 30 mph (50 km/h) and brake
forcefully (or if Automatic Emergency Braking engages),
the brake lights flash quickly to warn other drivers that
Model X is rapidly slowing down. If Model X stops
completely, the hazard warning lights flash. Flashing
continues until you press the accelerator or manually
press the hazard lights button to turn them off (see
Hazard Warning Flashers on page 84).
NOTE: When towing a trailer (if applicable), the brake
lights on the trailer also operate as described above,
even when the trailer is not equipped with a separate
braking system.
WARNING: When towing a trailer (if applicable),
always increase your following distance. Sudden
braking may result in skidding, jack-knifing, and
loss of control.

In an emergency, fully press the brake pedal and
maintain firm pressure, even on low traction surfaces.
The ABS varies the braking pressure to each wheel
according to the amount of traction available. This
prevents wheels from locking and ensures that you stop
as safely as possible.

86

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Braking and Stopping
Brake Disc Wiping
To ensure brakes remain responsive in cold and wet
weather, Model X is equipped with brake disc wiping.
When cold and wet weather is detected, this feature
repeatedly applies an imperceptible amount of brake
force to remove water from the surface of the brake
discs.

Hydraulic Fade Compensation
Model X is equipped with hydraulic fade compensation.
This assists in monitoring brake system pressure and
ABS activity for instances of reduced brake
performance. If reduced brake performance is detected
(for example, as a result of brake fade, or cold or wet
conditions), you may hear a sound, feel the brake pedal
pull away from your foot, and notice a strong increase in
braking. Brake as you normally would and continue to
press the brake pedal without releasing or pumping the
brakes.
CAUTION: In emergency situations, if the brakes
are not functioning properly, press and hold the
Park button on the center console or touchscreen
to bring Model X to a stop. Do not use this method
to stop the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.
WARNING: Always maintain a safe driving distance
from the vehicle in front of you and exercise
caution when driving conditions are hazardous.
Brake disc wiping and hydraulic fade
compensation is not a substitute for adequately
applying the brakes.

Hydraulic Boost Compensation
Model X is equipped with a brake booster that activates
the brakes when the brake pedal is pressed. Hydraulic
boost compensation provides mechanical assistance if
the brake booster fails. If a brake booster failure is
detected, the brake pedal feels stiffer to press and you
may hear a sound when you press the brake pedal. To
stop Model X, apply steady force to the brake pedal
without releasing or pumping. Drive cautiously and
maintain a safe distance from other road users—brake
pedal responsiveness and braking performance may be
degraded.

Regenerative Braking
Whenever Model X is moving and your foot is off the
accelerator, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle
and feeds any surplus power back to the Battery. By
anticipating your stops and reducing or removing
pressure from the accelerator pedal to slow down, you
can take advantage of regenerative braking to increase
driving range.

Driving

Vehicle deceleration due to regenerative braking may
vary depending on the current state of the Battery. For
example, regenerative braking may be limited if the
Battery is cold or is already fully charged.
To experience the same amount of deceleration
whenever you release the accelerator pedal, regardless
of the state of the Battery, you can choose to have the
regular braking system automatically engage whenever
regenerative braking is limited. Touch Controls > Pedals
& Steering > Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking
is Limited.
WARNING: Apply Brakes When Regenerative
Braking is Limited may not operate if the brakes
are extremely hot.
NOTE: If Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is
Limited is enabled and applying the brakes, the brake
pedal may move and it may feel stiffer when pressed.
This is expected and does not change your ability to
slow down Model X.
The power meter (a thin horizontal line centered at the
bottom of the instrument panel) displays real-time
power usage:

1. The left side of the power meter represents power
generated from regenerative braking, or power that is
used to slow down the vehicle. Power being fed back
to the Battery displays in green whereas power used
by the regular braking system displays in gray.
2. The right side of the power meter shows power being
output by the Battery, such as that used to accelerate
the vehicle or to cool the cabin. When you press the
accelerator pedal, the power meter fills to the right
with black (or white if the display is dark).
NOTE: To ensure visibility when the display is dark,
power represented by the gray color displays as white.
NOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound
and tread design may result in temporarily-reduced
regenerative braking power. However, your vehicle is
designed to continuously recalibrate itself, and after
changing tires it will increasingly restore regenerative
braking power after some straight-line accelerations. For
most drivers this occurs after a short period of normal
driving, but drivers who normally accelerate lightly may
need to use slightly harder accelerations while the
recalibration is in progress. Touch Service > Wheel &
Tire > Tires to select winter tires and quicken this
process.
NOTE: If regenerative braking is aggressively slowing
Model X (such as when your foot is completely off the
accelerator pedal at highway speeds), the brake lights
turn on to alert others that you are slowing down.

87

Braking and Stopping
WARNING: In snowy or icy conditions, Model X
may experience loss of traction during
regenerative braking.

Parking Brake
To engage the parking brake, touch Controls > Safety >
Parking Brake. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Use the touchscreen to manually release the parking
brake (which also shifts Model X into Neutral):
1. Touch Controls > Safety.
2. Press the brake pedal, then touch Parking Brake. If
Model X was previously in Park, it shifts into Neutral.
When you manually apply the parking
brake using the touchscreen, the red
parking brake indicator lights up on the
instrument panel.

Brake Wear
Model X brake pads are equipped with wear indicators.
A wear indicator is a thin metal strip attached to the
brake pad that squeals as it rubs against the rotor when
the pad wears down. This squealing sound indicates that
the brake pads have reached the end of their service life
and require replacement. To replace the brake pads,
contact Tesla Service.
Brakes must be periodically inspected visually by
removing the tire and wheel. For detailed specifications
and service limits for rotors and brake pads, see
Subsystems on page 214. Additionally, Tesla
recommends cleaning and lubricating the brake calipers
every year or 12,500 miles (20,000 km) if in an area
where roads are salted during winter months.
WARNING: Neglecting to replace worn brake pads
damages the braking system and can result in a
braking hazard.

If the parking brake experiences an
electrical issue, the amber parking brake
indicator lights up and a fault message
displays on the instrument panel.
NOTE: The parking brake operates on the rear wheels
only, and is independent of the pedal-operated brake
system.
CAUTION: In the unlikely event that Model X loses
electrical power, you cannot access the
touchscreen and are therefore unable to release
the parking brake without first jump starting (see
Jump Starting on page 229).
WARNING: In snowy or icy conditions the rear
wheels may not have sufficient traction to prevent
Model X from sliding down a slope, particularly if
not using winter tires. Avoid parking on hills in
snowy or icy conditions. You are always
responsible for parking safely.
WARNING: Your Model X may display an alert if
the road is too steep to safely park on, or if the
parking brakes are not properly engaged. These
alerts are for guidance purposes only and are not a
substitute for the driver’s judgment of safe parking
conditions, including specific road or weather
conditions. Do not depend on these alerts to
determine whether or not it is safe to park at any
location. You are always responsible for parking
safely.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Air Suspension
NOTE: When Model X starts, you may hear the sound of
the compressor as the air suspension system’s reservoir
fills with air.

• Low - Lowering the height can improve
aerodynamics, make it easier to load or unload cargo
and passengers, and improve handling.

Your Model X is equipped with Adaptive Air Suspension
that offers superior ride quality and allows you to
choose a softer or firmer ride based on your preference.
When carrying loads, the system also maintains a level
height between the front and rear. You can manually
adjust the ride height to suit your circumstances (for
example, you can raise Model X when you need extra
ground clearance, such as when driving on a steep
driveway or ramp, in deep snow, over large speed
bumps, parking curbs, etc.).

• Very Low - This setting takes effect when you
manually choose it or automatically at very high
speeds. The suspension will revert to Low on your
next drive, or when appropriate based on vehicle
speed.

If a fault is detected that reduces the
performance of the adaptive air suspension
system, a yellow indicator lights up on the
instrument panel. If the problem persists,
contact Tesla.
If a fault is detected that disables the
adaptive air suspension system, a red
indicator lights up on the instrument panel.
Contact Tesla.

Adjusting Ride Height
CAUTION: Before adjusting the suspension height,
ensure Model X is clear of all obstacles, above and
below.
You can manually adjust the ride height by pressing the
brake pedal and touching Controls > Suspension on the
touchscreen. The ride height settings that are available
depend on your driving speed and other conditions (for
example, the suspension does not lower if a door is
open). Drag the slider to choose from these options:
• Very High - When set to Very High, the suspension
automatically lowers to Low, after driving
approximately 100 feet (30 meters) or when driving
speed reaches 15 mph (24 km/h). To maintain the
Very High setting for an unlimited distance until your
driving speed reaches the speed threshold, touch
Persist until 15 mph in the setting for Very High.
• High - When set to High, the suspension
automatically lowers to or Low, after driving
approximately 100 feet (30 meters) or when driving
speed reaches 35 mph (56 km/h). To maintain the
High setting for an unlimited distance until your
driving speed reaches the speed threshold, touch
Persist until 35 mph.
NOTE: You can also raise the suspension to High by
touching the Raise Suspension shortcut on the main
Controls window.
• Medium - The Medium setting ensures optimum
comfort and handling under all loading conditions.
The suspension automatically lowers to Low when
driving speed exceeds 55 mph (89 km/h).
Driving

CAUTION: Avoid driving aggressively (hard
accelerations, sharp turns, etc.) when the
suspension is set to High or Very High. Doing so
can cause vibration and increase the possibility of
damage.

Adaptive Suspension Damping
The settings associated with Adaptive Suspension
Damping provide real-time adjustments to the
suspension system to optimize both ride and handling.
Choose from:
• Comfort - Provides a gentler ride for a relaxed driving
experience.
• Auto - Adjusts to a wide range of roads and driving
styles, providing a fluid yet well controlled ride.
• Sport - Provides a firmer, more controlled ride that
increases driver engagement and connection to the
road.
• Advanced - Can be used to fine tune the suspension
by dragging individual sliders that adjust Ride
Comfort and Handling.
Touch Show Suspension Data to display detailed
information about the dampers for each wheel, including
ride height, compression and rebound values, and body
accelerations.
NOTE: When Adaptive Suspension Damping is set to
Comfort or Auto, the suspension may raise to improve
ride comfort on rough roads. (U.S. only) This feature
depends on the availability of up-to-date map data that
includes data indicating rough road sections.
Use Comfort Damping in Autopilot (if equipped) - By
default, damping automatically sets to the Comfort
setting when using Autopilot, and reverts back to your
chosen setting when Autopilot is no longer in use. Turn
this setting off to disable this feature.

Real-time Visualization
The image of your Model X on the Suspension screen
provides a real-time visualization of the status of the air
suspension system. In addition to visually showing
changes to the ride height, it displays Compression and
Rebound lines that reflect how the suspension system is
controlling the dampers for each wheel based on your
chosen settings and changing road conditions. Both are
controlled simultaneously. Touch Show Suspension Data
89

Air Suspension
to display detailed information about the dampers for
each wheel, including ride height, compression and
rebound values, and body accelerations.

Auto-Raising Locations
Whenever you raise the suspension to High or Very
High, the location is automatically saved. By saving the
location, you do not need to manually raise the
suspension every time you arrive at a frequently-used
location where you have previously raised the
suspension. When you return to the saved location,
Model X raises the suspension and the instrument panel
displays a message indicating that the suspension is
being raised.
When saving locations, Model X also saves the Persist
until XX mph setting (if specified).
NOTE: When returning to a saved location and driving
faster than the High and Very High suspension settings
allow, the suspension does not raise until Model X slows
down.
NOTE: After leaving a saved location, the suspension
automatically lowers. However, it may not lower until
Model X meets the speed and distance threshold at
which the suspension lowers.
NOTE: If Model X reaches a saved location and the
existing suspension setting is already higher than the
level that has been saved for that location, the ride
height is not adjusted.

To remove an auto-raising location
If you do not want the suspension to automatically raise
at a location, touch to deselect Always raise at this
location in the popup that appears when you arrive at a
saved location. Or, when using the Raise Suspension
shortcut on the main Controls window, touch to deselect
Location Saved.

Self-Leveling
Model X equipped with air suspension automatically
self-levels, even when power is off. To prevent damage
when jacking or lifting the vehicle, you must activate
Jack Mode to disable self-leveling (press the brake pedal
and touch Controls > Service > Jack Mode). For more
details, see Jack Mode on page 205.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Park Assist
How Park Assist Works
This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until
it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles
manufactured as of approximately January 2023.
Model X is designed to detect the presence of objects.
When driving slowly in Drive or Reverse (for example,
when parking), the vehicle alerts you if an object is
detected in close proximity of your Model X. Objects are
only detected in your chosen direction; front objects in
Drive, rear objects in Reverse.
WARNING: You may not be alerted if Model X rolls
freely in the opposite direction (for example, Park
Assist does not display an alert if Model X rolls
backwards down a hill while in Drive).

NOTE: Park Assist may be disabled when a bicycle is
detected or Model X is in trailer mode.
WARNING: Never depend on Park Assist to inform
you if an area you are approaching is free of
objects and/or people. Several external factors can
reduce the performance of Park Assist, causing
either no readings or false readings (see
Limitations and False Warnings on page 92).
Therefore, depending on Park Assist to determine
if Model X is approaching an obstruction can result
in damage to the vehicle and/or objects, and can
potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the
area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform
shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Park assist
does not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists,
animals, or objects that are moving, protruding,
located too far above or below the sensors (if
equipped) or cameras, or too close or too far from
the sensors or cameras. Park Assist is for guidance
purposes only and is not intended to replace your
own direct visual checks. It is not a substitute for
careful driving.

Visual and Audio Feedback
When you shift to Reverse, the Park Assist view displays
on the left side of the instrument panel, showing objects
that are in close proximity to the front and rear of
Model X. This view closes when you shift into Drive
unless an object is detected close to the front of
Model X, in which case the Park Assist view closes
automatically when your driving speed exceeds 5 mph
(8 km/h). When reversing, visual feedback also displays
on the touchscreen (see Rear Facing Camera(s) on page
99). You can manually close the park assist view on the
touchscreen by touching the X.
When driving with the Camera app displayed on the
touchscreen, you can switch to the Park Assist view
when driving at speeds below 5 mph (8 km/h). Touch
the button located in the upper left corner of the
Camera app screen. This is useful if you need assistance
with parallel parking.
Park Assist is activated when driving slower than 5 mph
(8 km/h).

Driving

If chimes are turned on (see Controlling Audible
Feedback on page 92), an audible beep sounds as you
approach an object. You can temporarily mute the chime
by touching the speaker icon on the bottom corner of
the Park Assist view.

91

Park Assist
NOTE: If Park Assist is unable to provide feedback, the
instrument panel displays an alert message.
CAUTION: Keep sensors (if equipped) and
cameras clean from dirt, debris, snow, and ice.
Avoid using a high pressure power washer on the
sensors and cameras, and do not clean a sensor or
camera with a sharp or abrasive object that can
scratch or damage its surface.
CAUTION: Do not install accessories or stickers on
or near the sensors (if equipped) or cameras.

Controlling Audible Feedback
You can use Park Assist with or without audible
feedback. To turn chimes on or off, touch Controls >
Safety > Park Assist Chimes.

• An object that is mounted to Model X is interfering
with and/or obstructing Park Assist (such as a bike
rack or bumper sticker).
• Model X rolls freely in the opposite direction you
selected (for example, Park Assist does not display an
alert if Model X rolls backwards down a hill while in
Drive).

Other Parking Aids
In addition to Park Assist, when shifted into Reverse, the
backup camera displays a view of the area behind
Model X (see Rear Facing Camera(s) on page 99).

To mute the chimes temporarily, touch the speaker icon
in the bottom corner of the Park Assist view. The chimes
are muted until you shift or drive over 5 mph (8 km/h).

Limitations and False Warnings
Park Assist may not function correctly in these
situations:
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras
is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice,
or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or
adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber
coating, etc.).
• The object is located below approximately 8 inches
(20 cm) (such as a curb or low barrier).
CAUTION: Shorter objects that are detected
(such as curbs or low barriers) can move into a

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Vehicle Hold
When Model X is stopped, Vehicle Hold can continue to
apply the brakes even after you remove your foot from
the brake pedal.
When the vehicle's stopping mode is set to Hold, Vehicle
Hold is automatically enabled any time the vehicle
comes to a complete stop.
This indicator displays on the instrument
panel whenever Vehicle Hold is actively
braking Model X.

To disengage Vehicle Hold, press the accelerator pedal
or press and release the brake pedal.
NOTE: Shifting into Neutral also disengages Vehicle
Hold.
NOTE: After actively braking Model X for approximately
ten minutes, Model X shifts into Park and Vehicle Hold
cancels. Model X also shifts into Park if it detects that
the driver has left the vehicle.

Traction Control
How It Works
The traction control system constantly monitors the
speed of the front and rear wheels. If Model X
experiences a loss of traction, the system minimizes
wheel spin by controlling brake pressure and motor
power. By default, the traction control system is on.
Under normal conditions, it should remain on to ensure
maximum safety.
This yellow indicator flashes on the
instrument panel whenever the traction
control system is actively controlling brake
pressure and motor power to minimize
wheel spin. If the indicator stays on, a fault
is detected with the traction control
system. Contact Tesla Service.
WARNING: Traction control cannot prevent
collisions caused by driving dangerously or turning
too sharply at high speeds.

Allowing Wheel Slip
To allow the wheels to spin at a limited speed, you can
enable Slip Start. Slip Start can be enabled only when
Model X is moving 30 mph (48 km/h) or slower. Slip
Start automatically disables when the speed exceeds
50 mph (80 km/h).
Under normal conditions, Slip Start should not be
enabled. Enable it only in circumstances where you
deliberately want the wheels to spin, such as:
• Starting on a loose surface, such as gravel or snow.
• Driving in deep snow, sand or mud.
• Rocking out of a hole or deep rut.
To allow the wheels to spin, touch Controls > Pedals &
Steering > Slip Start.
The instrument panel displays an alert
message when Slip Start is enabled.

Although Slip Start is automatically disabled the next
time you start Model X, it is strongly recommended that
you disable it immediately after the circumstances that
required you to enable it have passed.
NOTE: Slip Start can not be enabled when you are
actively using cruise control.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Acceleration Modes
Touch Controls > Pedals & Steering > Acceleration to
choose a preferred acceleration mode:
• Chill limits acceleration for a slightly smoother and
gentler ride.
NOTE: When Chill is selected, Chill displays on the
instrument panel, above the driving speed.
• Sport provides the normal level of acceleration.
• Insane (called Plaid on performance vehicles, if
equipped) provides the maximum level of
acceleration immediately available.
NOTE: Using the increased torque and power
available in Insane or Plaid mode can reduce range
and efficiency.
NOTE: Insane or Plaid strives to keep the Battery
within an optimal temperature range. In addition to
heating the Battery, these settings also cool the
Battery when necessary (for example, while driving at
high speeds, during rapid acceleration, driving for
long periods, etc.).
NOTE: You can improve the efficiency of the cabin
heating by reducing your selected acceleration mode.
This allows the heat pump system to take more heat
from the Battery to efficiently heat the cabin, instead of
maintaining the Battery's ability to provide peak
acceleration performance. This helps to maximize
driving efficiency in colder weather. Note that when
subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the
Battery requires time to warm up before the increased
level of acceleration is available.

WARNING: Drag Strip Mode is designed for use on
closed circuit driving courses only. It is the driver’s
responsibility to ensure that driving style and
acceleration do not endanger or inconvenience
other road users.

How to Launch the Vehicle
The touchscreen provides visual instructions on how to
launch:
1. Touch Controls > Pedals & Steering > Drag Strip
Mode.
2. Wait for the instrument panel to indicate that the
vehicle is Peak Performance Ready.
3. With Model X shifted into Drive and at a complete
stop, firmly hold the brake pedal with your left foot,
then fully press the accelerator pedal.
4. Once step 3 is complete, the front suspension begins
lowering into a "cheetah stance".
5. Wait for the instrument panel to indicate that Drag
Strip Mode is Ready to Launch.
6. Once you see "Cheetah Stance Enabled" and "Ready
to launch" on the instrument panel, release the brake
pedal to launch the vehicle.

In addition, Model X features Drag Strip Mode. Using
Drag Strip Mode to precondition your Model X is useful
before a short distance race.

Drag Strip Mode
Drag Strip Mode preconditions the Battery and drive
unit to ideal operating temperatures for timed
acceleration. Model X stays in Drag Strip Mode for three
hours, even if you leave the vehicle. After three hours,
the feature times out to prevent unnecessary energy
consumption (for example, you leave the vehicle and
forget to cancel Drag Strip Mode).
When using Drag Strip Mode, Model X consumes more
energy to keep the Battery within an optimal
temperature range.
Cancel Drag Strip Mode at any time by toggling Drag
Strip Mode off.
NOTE: Drag Strip Mode automatically disables Slip Start
when enabled.

toggle the driver icon to link or delete a key to the
desired driver profile. The name of the driver profile
appears under the key to show that it is linked.
NOTE: Model X supports up to 10 driver profiles. You can
link multiple keys to a driver profile, but you cannot link
multiple driver profiles to a single key.

Easy Entry
You can define an Easy Entry setting that moves the
steering yoke (or steering wheel) and driver's seat to
make it easy to enter and exit Model X. Any driver can
use the Easy Entry setting by associating it with their
driver profile. When the Easy Entry setting is associated
with a driver profile, the steering yoke (or steering
wheel) and driver's seat automatically adjust when in
Park and the driver's seat belt is unbuckled, allowing an
easy exit from Model X. When returning to the vehicle
and stepping on the brake pedal, settings automatically
adjust back to the settings used by the most recent
driver profile (or based on the key if it's linked to a driver
profile).
To use Easy Entry with a driver profile, ensure the Use
Easy Entry box is checked.
WARNING: Never use Easy Entry to move the
driver's seat to the full rearward position when a
child safety seat is installed on a rear seat located
behind the driver's seat. With reduced clearance,
the movement of the seat may impact a child's
legs, cause injury, or dislodge the seat.

Valet Mode
When Model X is in Valet mode, the following
restrictions apply:
• Key card must be used to access and drive Model X.

• Driver Profiles are not accessible.
• Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled. When Model X is in

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Rear Facing Camera(s)
Camera Location
Model X is equipped with a rear view camera located
above the rear license plate.

WARNING: Never depend on the cameras to
inform you if the area behind you is free of objects
and/or people. The cameras may not detect
objects or barriers that can potentially cause
damage or injury. In addition, several external
factors can reduce the performance of the
cameras, including a dirty or obstructed lens.
Therefore, depending on the cameras to determine
if Model X is approaching an obstruction can result
in damage to the vehicle and/or objects and can
potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the
area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform
shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Use the
cameras for guidance purposes only. It is not
intended to replace your own direct visual checks
and is not a substitute for careful driving.

Cleaning a Camera
To ensure a clear picture, the camera lens must be clean
and free of obstructions. There are two different
methods to clean a camera, depending on when your
vehicle was built.
For vehicles built prior to approximately January 12,
2023: Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying
water onto the camera lens with a spray bottle. Do not
attempt to remove dirt or debris by wiping an exposed
lens with your hands or a cloth. This debris can damage
the surface of the lens when rubbed against it during
wiping.

Whenever you shift into Reverse, the touchscreen
displays the view from the camera. Lines show your
driving path based on the position of the steering yoke
(or steering wheel). These lines adjust as you move the
steering yoke (or steering wheel).
Model X also displays images from the side cameras (if
equipped). Simply swipe up or down to hide or show the
side camera views.
NOTE: Visual feedback from Park Assist also appears on
the instrument panel (see Park Assist on page 91).

For vehicles built as of approximately January 12, 2023:
Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying water
onto the camera lens and drying it with a microfiber
cloth. Clean the camera lens every week during wet
weather (snow, rain, sleet) and every month during dry
weather.
CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive
cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the
lens.
CAUTION: Do not clean an ultrasonic sensor (if
equipped) or camera lens with a sharp or abrasive
object that can scratch or damage its surface.

To display the view from the rear view
cameras at any time, open the app
launcher and touch the Camera app.

If a black screen appears on the touchscreen instead of
the rear view camera feed when in Reverse, use the rear
view mirrors and ensure your surroundings are safe
before continuing to Reverse. If inoperability of the rear
view camera persists, use the mobile app to schedule a
service appointment.

Pedestrian Warning System
The Pedestrian Warning System causes Model X to emit
sound when driving below approximately 32 km/h (19
mph), or while driving in reverse. Electric vehicles
operate quietly and this sound helps to alert pedestrians
of your oncoming vehicle. The sound, which activates
whenever Model X is shifted out of Park, gets louder as
speed increases.
WARNING: If sound cannot be heard, pedestrians
may not be aware of your oncoming vehicle, which
may increase the likelihood of a collision resulting
in serious injury or death. If the Pedestrian
Warning System is not operating, immediately
contact Tesla.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Towing and Accessories
The towing package allows you to tow a trailer with your
Model X. It also allows you to carry skis, snowboards,
bicycles, etc. by attaching an accessory carrier to the
hitch.

Carrying Accessories
The Model X towing package has a 2 inch hitch receiver
that can support an accessory carrier.
The hitch receiver is designed to support vertical loads
of up to 120 lbs (54 kg) when the load is cantilevered
rearward within 24 inches (63 cm) of the hitch receiver,
such as when carrying bikes on an accessory rack.
When carrying bicycles or other items on the Model X
hitch, always check to ensure that the maximum weight
is not exceeded. When calculating weight, remember to
include the weight of the accessory carrier. For example,
assuming the carrier weighs 40 lbs, the weight threshold
is sufficient for carrying two bicycles weighing
approximately 40 lbs each, or four bicycles weighing
approximately 20 lbs each.
CAUTION: The Model X hitch is designed to
support up to 120 lbs (54 kg). Exceeding this
maximum weight can cause significant damage.

NOTE: Go to www.tesla.com to purchase accessories for
your Model X. Although third-party products are
available, Tesla recommends and supports only Teslaapproved products (see Parts and Accessories on page
206). The accessory products available for your Model X
vary based on market region. Before attempting to
install a non-Tesla carrier, review the product information
to ensure compatibility.
NOTE: When not in use, the hitch receiver should be
removed and stored in a dry location to prevent rust and
corrosion. Keep the dust cover over the hitch housing to
prevent dirt and debris from entering (see
Disconnecting the Tow Hitch on page 107).
CAUTION: A carrier may obscure your view from
the rear view mirror, the rear camera(s), and/or the
rear ultrasonic sensors. In addition, some Autopilot
features may not function as expected.
WARNING: Tesla assumes no responsibility for
damage or injuries resulting from installing and
using an accessory carrier, for any omissions in the
instructions accompanying an accessory carrier, or
for your failure to follow the instructions. Damage
caused by using an accessory carrier is not
covered by the warranty.

CAUTION: Do not attempt to install a carrier on a
Model X that is not equipped with the towing
package. Doing so can cause significant damage.
To install and use an accessory carrier, the tow hitch
must be connected (see Connecting the Tow Hitch on
page 106). Then follow the instructions provided with
your accessory carrier. Observe all regulations and legal
requirements in your state/region that apply to carrying
accessories.
The Model X towing package includes the wiring
necessary for using an accessory carrier equipped with
lights (see Electrical Connections on page 108). The
package also includes Trailer Mode software (see Trailer
Mode on page 103).
When you connect an accessory carrier's
wiring harness, Model X detects a
connection for trailer lights and this
indicator illuminates on the instrument
panel. Trailer Mode is disabled.
When carrying accessories, periodically confirm that the
accessory carrier and its cargo remain secure at all
times, and if applicable, that the lights on the accessory
carrier are working.

Driving

101

Towing and Accessories
Towing Capacity
The total trailer weight (including all cargo and additional equipment), and the trailer tongue weight, must never
exceed the following:
Wheel/Rim Size
275/45R20 110 V / Y

285/35R22 106 W

Maximum Towing Capacity*
SAE Class III – 5000 lb (2300 kg)

SAE Class II - 3500 lb (1588 kg)

Maximum Tongue Weight**
SAE Class III – 500 lb (230 kg)

SAE Class II – 350 lb (158 kg)

*Tesla recommends a separate braking system on trailers with a loaded weight of over 1000 lbs (450 kg). The
braking system must be appropriate for the weight of the trailer. Follow the instructions provided by the trailer brake
manufacturer to ensure that trailer brakes are properly installed, adjusted, and maintained.
**The tongue weight is the downward force that the weight of the trailer exerts on the hitch. It must not be less than
10% of the trailer load. Carrying a significant amount of equipment, passengers, or cargo in the tow vehicle can
reduce the tongue weight it can handle, which also reduces the maximum towing capacity. Maximum towing
capacity is calculated assuming the GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) is not exceeded. The GVWR is printed on
the Vehicle Certification Label (see Vehicle Certification Label on page 209).
NOTE: If the towing capacity on the hitch label conflicts with the information provided in this owner's manual, this
owner's manual takes precedence.
WARNING: Do not overload the vehicle or trailer. Doing so can cause poor performance, vehicle damage and
loss of vehicle control, resulting in serious injury.
WARNING: Do not use the trailer hitch to tow/transport Model X.
CAUTION: Tesla assumes no responsibility for damage or injuries resulting from towing a trailer, for any errors
or omissions in the instructions accompanying towing equipment, or for your failure to follow the proper
instructions. Damage caused by towing a trailer is not covered by the warranty.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Towing and Accessories
Tire Pressures when Towing
When towing a trailer, tire pressures must be adjusted to
accommodate the additional load. Keep tires inflated to
the pressures shown below (these pressures override the
pressures that are provided on the Tire and Loading
information label):
Front Tires
255/45R20

Rear Tires
275/45R20

Cold Tire Inflation Pressure
46 psi (320 kPa)

• All trailer hitch parts and attachments , safety chains,
and electrical connectors are in good condition and
are properly connected. If any problems are apparent,
do not tow the trailer.
• Trailer lights (brake lights, turn signal lights, and
marker lights) are working properly.
• The trailer tongue is securely connected to the hitch
ball.

265/45R20

265/35ZR22 285/35ZR22

• Model X rests horizontally with the trailer attached. If
the vehicle is tipped up at the front, and down at the
rear, check that you are not exceeding the maximum
towing capacity and tongue loads provided in
Carrying Capacity.

50 psi (345 kPa)

WARNING: Check tire pressures using an accurate
pressure gauge when tires are cold. Driving one
mile (1.6 km) warms the tires sufficiently to affect
tire pressures. Parking the vehicle in direct sunlight
or in hot weather can also affect tire pressures. If
you must check warm tires, expect increased
pressures. Do not let air out of warm tires in an
attempt to match recommended cold tire
pressures. A hot tire at or below the recommended
cold tire inflation pressure is dangerously underinflated.
WARNING: Never attempt to tow a trailer when a
Model X tire is faulty or has been inflated using a
tire repair kit. A temporarily repaired tire is not
designed to sustain the towing load. Towing using
a faulty or temporarily repaired tire can result in
tire failure and loss of vehicle stability.

Before Towing a Trailer
Before towing a trailer, you must do the following:
• Inflate tires to the cold tire inflation pressure
specified in Tire Pressures when Towing.
• Set the Suspension height to Low (touch Controls >
Suspension > Low).
• Observe all regulations and legal requirements in
your state/region that apply to trailer towing. Failure
to comply with regulations can compromise your
safety.

• Safety chains are properly connected between the
trailer and the tow vehicle. Cross the safety chains
under the tongue of the trailer to help prevent the
tongue from contacting the road if it separates from
the hitch. Leave enough slack in the safety chains to
allow for turns and ensure that the chains can never
drag on the ground.
• All cargo is secured.
• Wheel chocks are available.
• The trailer load is evenly distributed such that the
trailer tongue weight is approximately 10% of the
total trailer weight, without exceeding the maximum
tongue weights provided in Carrying Capacity.
• If the trailer is equipped with a separate braking
system, check that the brakes work and are properly
adjusted. To provide safe stopping ability, you must
balance the trailer brakes with the vehicle brakes.
NOTE: For general information about trailer safety
provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, go to: http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/
problems/Equipment/towing/Towing.pdf.
WARNING: The trailer tongue weight must be
approximately 10% of the total trailer weight
without exceeding the maximum tongue weights
provided in Carrying Capacity. Loads that are
balanced over the wheels or heavier in the rear can
cause trailer sway, resulting in loss of vehicle
control.
WARNING: Always ensure that cargo is secured in
the trailer and will not shift. Dynamic load shifts
can cause loss of vehicle control, resulting in
serious injury or death.

• Adjust side mirrors to provide a clear rearward view
without a significant blind spot.

Trailer Mode

• Engage Trailer Mode (see Trailer Mode on page 103).

Trailer Mode must always be active when towing a trailer.
When you connect a trailer's electrical connection,
Model X automatically engages Trailer Mode. When you
disconnect the trailer's electrical connection, Trailer
Mode disengages. To engage or exit Trailer Mode
manually, touch Controls > Pedals & Steering > Trailer

Towing and Accessories
Trailer Mode is active.

Trailer Brakes

Model X detects a connection for trailer
lights but Trailer Mode is disabled. It is
likely that a carrying accessory has been
connected.

When towing a loaded trailer that weighs more than
1000 lbs (450 kg), Tesla recommends that the trailer be
equipped with its own brake system adequate for the
weight of the trailer. Ensure compliance with local
regulations. A brake controller must be purchased
separately, and the required 4-pin pigtail connector can
be ordered from Tesla Service.
Follow these steps to connect a brake controller:

Model X detects a faulty electrical
connection for the trailer lights. Some, or
all, trailer lights may not be functioning.
Pull over as soon as safety permits and
inspect the trailer lights for faulty cabling
or connections. If the issues are resolved
and the red icon still persists, turn Trailer
Mode off and on again.

1. Connect the wiring on the brake controller to the
appropriate locations on the 4-pin pigtail connector.

Some Autopilot features, as well as rear parking sensor
functionality, may not be available when Trailer Mode is
enabled. In addition, some features may operate
differently. For example:
• Autosteer is unavailable.
• For Traffic-Aware Cruise Control availability, first set
Controls > Autopilot > Autosteer Activation >
Double Click. Then, engage Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control with a single press of the right steering yoke
scroll button.
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control increases the following
distance from the car in front of you.
• The air suspension system will not make speed-based

• The air suspension system does not automatically
raise ride height based on saved locations.
• Side collision warnings are active but automatic
steering interventions are disabled.
• The braking force provided by Automatic Emergency
Braking (see Collision Avoidance Assist on page 145)
is significantly limited.
WARNING: Do not rely on Model X to detect the
trailer and automatically engage Trailer Mode.
Always check that Trailer Mode is engaged before
towing a trailer.
WARNING: Under no circumstances should you
exit Trailer Mode when towing a trailer. Doing so
can cause serious injury and/or death.

1 - Brake control output to trailer
2 - Ground
3 - Brake On Signal
4 - Low Voltage Power (20A)
2. Remove the cover located under the dashboard in
the driver's side foot well.

WARNING: Do not use the suspension setting to
appropriately match the height of the hitch with
the height of the trailer. You must choose a trailer
hitch and trailer that have the appropriate height
for suitable axle loading and trailer balance.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Towing and Accessories
WARNING: Never attempt to connect trailer brakes
directly to the vehicle braking system. Doing so
can cause damage to the vehicle and the trailer,
and can cause the braking system to malfunction,
resulting in serious injury or death.

Towing Guidelines
Model X is designed primarily as a passenger-carrying
vehicle. Towing a trailer puts additional load on the
motor(s), drive train, brakes, tires, and suspension and
significantly decreases range. If you decide to tow a
trailer, proceed with caution and follow these general
guidelines:

3. Peel back the carpet to expose Model X's 4-pin
connector on the wiring harness.

• Reduce your driving speed and avoid sudden
maneuvers. Keep in mind that when towing a trailer,
steering, stability, turning radius, stopping distance
and braking performance are different when
compared to driving without a trailer.
• Increase your following distance by maintaining at
least twice the distance from a vehicle ahead. This
helps to avoid situations that require heavy braking.
Sudden braking may result in skidding or jack-knifing,
and loss of control.
• Avoid sharp turns. Sharp turns can cause the trailer to
contact the vehicle and cause damage. Keep in mind
that the trailer wheels are closer to the inside of the
turn than the vehicle’s wheels. Therefore, make wider
turns to prevent the trailer from hitting curbs, road
signs, trees or other objects.
• Periodically check the trailer lights and turn signals to
confirm that bulbs are still working. When towing a
trailer, the turn signal arrows on the vehicle
instrument cluster flash as normal, even if the bulbs
on the trailer are burned out.

4. Connect the pigtail connector to the vehicle wiring
connector.
WARNING: Towing increases your stopping
distance, even when the trailer is equipped with its
own braking system. When towing, increase your
following distance and avoid situations that could
potentially cause heavy braking. Failure to do so
can result in a collision.
WARNING: Observe all regulations and legal
requirements in your regional and national
jurisdictions that apply specifically to trailer towing
and brake requirements. Many regions require a
breakaway switch, located on the tongue of the
trailer, to activate the trailer brakes in the event
that the trailer separates from the vehicle. Failure
to comply with regulations can compromise your
safety.
WARNING: Follow the instructions provided by the
trailer brake manufacturer to ensure that trailer
brakes are properly installed, adjusted, and
maintained. Tesla is not responsible for damages
caused by incorrect installation of trailer braking
systems.
Driving

• Periodically confirm the cargo is secure.
• Periodically confirm the trailer brakes are working.
• Avoid parking on a grade (see Parking with a Trailer
on page 105).
• Regularly confirm that all towing components are
securely tightened.

Parking with a Trailer
Whenever possible, avoid parking on a grade. However,
if parking on a grade is absolutely necessary, place
wheel chocks under the trailer wheels:
• One person presses and holds the brake pedal.
• A second person places the wheel chocks under the
wheels on the downgrade side of the vehicle's tires.
• When the chocks are in place, release the brake pedal
and ensure the chocks hold the weight of the vehicle
and trailer.

105

Towing and Accessories
NOTE: When testing chocks, ensure that Vehicle Hold
(see Vehicle Hold on page 93) is not engaged. If
Vehicle Hold is braking Model X, the Vehicle Hold
indicator light displays on the instrument panel. To
disengage Vehicle Hold, press and release the brake
pedal.
• Place the vehicle in Park.
WARNING: If parking on a grade is necessary,
always ensure that all trailer wheels have been
securely chocked. Failure to do so can result in
serious damage, injury, or death.

Trailer Sway Mitigation
When trailer sway is detected, the Model X electronic
stability control system attempts to apply the
appropriate amount of braking to minimize trailer sway.
The instrument panel briefly displays the traction control
system indicator. Pressing the brake pedal when the
system is actively braking to mitigate trailer sway does
not cancel this automatic braking.

Connecting the Tow Hitch
The Model X towing package includes a weight-carrying
hitch with a 2” x 2” removable hitch receiver. When not
in use, the hitch receiver should be removed and stored
in a dry location to prevent rust and corrosion. Keep the
dust cover over the hitch housing to prevent dirt and
debris from entering.

The trailer hitch assembly is attached to the body of the
vehicle with 8 nuts.

106

NOTE: The maximum permissible rear overhang for the
coupling point is 47 inches (1186 mm).
NOTE: Always attach safety chains when towing. Cross
the chains under the trailer tongue and attach to the
trailer eyelets to ensure the security of the trailer load.
CAUTION: Always remove the ball mount before
installing or removing the hitch receiver from the
vehicle (see Attaching and Removing the Ball
Mount on page 108).
WARNING: You must use the Model X trailer hitch
when towing a trailer. Never attempt to attach a
different type of trailer hitch.
To install the trailer hitch receiver:
1. Remove the dust cover from the hitch housing.

NOTE: Model X may have two push clips that secure
the dust cover to the vehicle. To open, use a sharp
object, such as a flat screwdriver, to carefully pry the
clips open. Remove the dust cover.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Towing and Accessories
NOTE: Do not grasp the locking cylinder because it
needs to rotate freely.
5. Push the hitch into the hitch housing until the locking
cylinder rotates approximately 120° counterclockwise and automatically locks into the "Closed
Position". The green area on the locking cylinder
(above the white arrow) aligns with the white dot on
the housing.
6. Visually check to confirm that the hitch is fully
inserted into the housing. Try pulling down on the
hitch. The hitch should not drop when you pull down.
NOTE: If the hitch does not lock into the housing, it
falls out when you pull down on it.
7. Turn the key so the arrows align with the “locked”
marking on the locking cylinder.
8. Remove the key and store it in a safe place
(preferably inside the vehicle).
NOTE: The key can be removed only if the hitch is
locked. This indicates a proper connection. Do not
use the hitch if the key is not removed.
2. Insert the key into the locking cylinder on the hitch,
and turn the cylinder so the top of the key is aligned
with the “unlocked” position.

NOTE: Tesla recommends making a note of the key
code. You need this code if you lose the keys and
need to order a replacement.

3. Pull the locking cylinder out of the adapter
approximately 1/8" (0.5 cm), and turn clockwise until
the red marking on the cylinder aligns with the white
dot.

9. Close the dust cover to prevent dirt and debris from
entering the lock. For newer version with push clips,
reattach the dust cover, snap it in place and open the
push clips before pushing them in.
NOTE: To maintain the hitch, regularly grease its
surfaces with non-resinous grease.

Disconnecting the Tow Hitch
After towing, remove the hitch:
1. Insert the key and turn to align the top of the key
with the “unlocked” position.
WARNING: Be careful when turning the locking
cylinder. If it does not lock into the “Open
Position”, it automatically retracts into its
original “Closed Position” and can pinch your
fingers.

2. While firmly holding the bottom of the hitch (to
prevent it from dropping to the ground), pull the
locking cylinder out approximately 1/8" (0.5 cm), and
turn it clockwise until the red marking on the locking
cylinder aligns with the white dot. At this point, the
locking cylinder is locked in the "open" and the hitch
drops out of the housing.

4. Firmly grasp the hitch from the bottom and align the
triangular-shaped guides at the sides of the hitch
with the corresponding cutouts in the hitch housing.

fingers.
3. Reinstall the dust cover on the hitch housing to
prevent dirt from accumulating inside the housing.
4. Close the dust cover on the hitch's locking cylinder
and store the hitch in a secure location.

Electrical Connections
Regulations require all trailers to be equipped with tail
lights, brake lights, side marker lights, and turn signals.
To provide power for trailer lighting, a built-in seven-way
wiring connector (SAE J560) is attached near the tow
hitch. Most trailer wiring plugs can be attached to this
connector.

Attaching and Removing the Ball
Mount
The Model X towing package does not include a ball
mount. You must purchase a ball mount suitable for the
type of trailer you are towing. The Model X hitch receiver
supports a ball mount up to 8” with a rise of up to 0.75”.
Do not use any type of drop ball mount.

To attach a ball mount:
1. If necessary, remove the cotter pin from the locking
bolt and slide the locking bolt out of the hitch
assembly.
2. Slide the ball holder into the hitch assembly.
3. Align the hole in the ball holder with the one in the
hitch assembly.
4. Slide the locking bolt through the hitch assembly/ball
holder.
5. Insert the cotter pin in the hole at the end of the
locking bolt.
To remove a ball mount:
1. Remove the cotter pin from the locking bolt and slide
the locking bolt out of the ball holder/hitch assembly.
2. Pull the ball holder out of the hitch assembly.

not detect faulty trailer lights. You must perform manual
checks.
NOTE: Loss of trailer lights when towing may be the
result of a fault in the trailer wiring or excessive power
consumption by the lights connected to the trailer
output(s). When this occurs, a red Trailer Mode icon
appears on the touchscreen. Fix any issues with the
wiring and/or reduce the number of lights connected to
the trailer output(s), then toggle Trailer Mode off and on
again.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Towing and Accessories
Plugging trailer wiring into the Model X electrical
connector automatically engages Trailer Mode (see
Trailer Mode on page 103).
WARNING: The brake controller output operates
only when a brake controller is installed (see Trailer
Brakes on page 104).
WARNING: Use only the electrical connection
designed by Tesla. Do not attempt to directly
splice or attempt to connect trailer electrical
wiring using any other method. Doing so can
damage the vehicle electrical system and cause
malfunctions.
CAUTION: Always ensure that the trailer electrical
cable does not contact or drag on the ground and
there is enough slack in the cable to allow for
turns.

Impact on Range
Towing a trailer and carrying accessories increases
vehicle weight and drag. As a result, driving range can
decrease significantly. Although Trip Planner attempts to
adjust estimates based on Trailer Mode, actual energy
consumption may vary. Plan trip length and charging
destinations accordingly.

About Autopilot
How It Works
Your Model X includes the following components that actively monitor the surrounding area:

1. A camera is mounted above the rear license plate.
2. Ultrasonic sensors (if equipped) are located in the front and rear bumpers.
3. A camera is mounted in each door pillar.
4. Three cameras are mounted to the windshield above the rear view mirror.
5. A camera is mounted to each front fender.
6. Radar (if equipped) is mounted behind the front bumper.
Model X is also equipped with high precision electronically-assisted braking and steering systems.
In addition, the cabin camera (if equipped) can determine driver inattentiveness and provide alerts when Autopilot is
engaged. By default, data from the camera does not leave the vehicle itself. In other words, data is not saved or
transmitted unless you enable data sharing. To enable data sharing, touch Controls > Software > Data Sharing >
Allow Cabin Camera Analytics. Cabin Camera Analytics helps Tesla continue to develop even safer vehicles in the
future. See Cabin Camera on page 149.
NOTE: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean before each drive. See Cleaning Cameras and Sensors
on page 112 for more information. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.

on page 132)
You can enable/disable some of these features and in
some cases, control how they work. To access settings
associated with these features, touch Controls >
Autopilot.

Drive to Calibrate Cameras
Model X must maneuver with precision when Autopilot
features are being used. Therefore, before some features
can be used for the first time or after some types of
service repairs, cameras must complete a self-calibration
process. For your convenience, the instrument panel
displays a progress indicator.
Autopilot

When calibration is complete, Autopilot features are
available for use. Calibration typically completes after
driving 20-25 miles (32-40 km), but the distance varies
depending on road and environmental conditions. For
example, calibration completes quicker when driving on
a straight road with multiple lanes (such as a controlledaccess highway), with highly-visible lane markings (in
the driving lane as well as the adjacent lanes). Contact
Tesla only if your Model X has not completed the
calibration process after driving 100 miles (160 km) in
the described conditions.
If a camera has shifted from its calibrated position (for
example, the camera or windshield was replaced), you
must clear the calibration. To do so, touch Controls >
Service > Camera Calibration > Clear Calibration. When
the calibration is cleared, Model X repeats the calibration
process. While this helps re-calibrate the cameras in
many cases, Clear Calibration may not resolve all
camera and sensor concerns.
NOTE: To calibrate, cameras require highly-visible lane
markings in both the driving lane and adjacent lanes (at
least two lanes over on each side of the vehicle). For
best results, drive in the middle lane of a multi-lane
highway (ideally with at least five lanes) that has clear
lane markings and minimal traffic.
NOTE: If you attempt to use a feature that is not
available until the calibration process is complete, the
feature is disabled and the instrument panel displays a
message.
NOTE: Model X must repeat the calibration process if
the cameras are serviced by Tesla, and in some cases,
after a software update.

Limitations
Many factors can impact the performance of Autopilot
components, causing them to be unable to function as
intended. These include (but are not limited to):
• Poor visibility (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct
sunlight, etc.).
• Damage or obstructions caused by mud, ice, snow,
etc.
• Interference or obstruction by object(s) mounted
onto the vehicle (such as a bike rack).
• Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or
adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber
coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
• Traffic signs that do not conform to standard
recognizable formats, such as digital or temporary
speed signs.
• Narrow or winding roads.
• A damaged or misaligned body panel.
• Use of gray or aftermarket glass.

111

About Autopilot
• Interference from other equipment that generates
ultrasonic waves.
• Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
CAUTION: If a windshield replacement is needed,
take your vehicle to Tesla Service. This ensures
appropriate handling and mounting of the
camera(s). Failure to do so can cause one or more
Autopilot features to malfunction.
WARNING: The list above does not represent an
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with
proper operation of Autopilot components. Never
depend on these components to keep you safe. It
is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive
safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times.
WARNING: Advanced safety features may not be
available during the calibration period.
WARNING: Re-calibrating the cameras or sensors
(if equipped) on the touchscreen is not a
substitute for checking the physical positioning
and condition of these components. Walk around
your vehicle and inspect the cameras and sensors
for physical damage. Incorrectly calibrated or
positioned cameras and sensors may limit or
disable the use of safety features. Contact Tesla if
you suspect lingering issues.

Cleaning Cameras and Sensors
To ensure the various Autopilot components can provide
information that is as accurate as possible, keep cameras
and sensors (if equipped) clean and free of obstructions,
condensation, or damage (see Cleaning on page 199).
Condensation can form inside the camera enclosures,
especially if you park your vehicle outside in cold or wet
conditions. The instrument cluster may display an alert
stating that a camera is blocked and that some or all
Autopilot features may be temporarily restricted until
the camera vision is clear. To proactively dry the
condensation, precondition the cabin by setting it to a
warm temperature, turning the windshield defroster on,
and directing the front air vents toward the door pillars
(see Mobile App on page 63).
CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive
cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the
lens.
CAUTION: Do not clean an ultrasonic sensor (if
equipped) or camera lens with a sharp or abrasive
object that can scratch or damage its surface.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Traffic-Aware
Cruise Control, or the feature may not operate exactly as
described. If your vehicle is not equipped, refer to the
owner's manual on your vehicle's touchscreen for
instructions on how to use Cruise Control.
NOTE: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is a BETA feature.
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control determines when there is a
vehicle in front of you in the same lane. If the area in
front of Model X is clear, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
maintains a set driving speed. When a vehicle is
detected, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed to
slow down Model X as needed to maintain a selected
time-based distance from the vehicle in front, up to the
set speed. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control does not
eliminate the need to watch the road in front of you and
to manually apply the brakes when needed.

detected ahead of you, you can initiate Traffic-Aware
Cruise Control at any speed, even when stationary,
provided Model X is at least 5 feet (1.5 m) behind the
detected vehicle and certain vehicle and environmental
conditions are met.
NOTE: The maximum cruising speed is 90 mph (150
km/h). It is the driver's responsibility to cruise at a safe
speed based on road conditions and speed limits.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is
available but not engaged, the instrument
panel displays the cruising speed in gray.
The number shown represents the cruising
speed that will be set when you engage
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is
actively cruising at a set cruising speed,
the cruising speed is highlighted with blue
text.

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is primarily intended for
driving on dry, straight roads, such as highways.
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean before each drive. Dirty
cameras and sensors, as well as environmental
conditions such as rain and faded lane markings,
can affect Autopilot performance.
WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is
designed for your driving comfort and
convenience and is not a collision warning or
avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay
alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle
at all times. Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control to adequately slow down Model X. Always
watch the road in front of you and be prepared to
take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so
can result in serious injury or death.
WARNING: Although Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
is capable of detecting pedestrians and cyclists,
never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to
adequately slow Model X down for them. Always
watch the road in front of you and be prepared to
take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so
can result in serious injury or death.
WARNING: Do not use Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control on winding roads with sharp curves, on icy
or slippery road surfaces, or when weather
conditions (such as heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.)
make it inappropriate to drive at a consistent
speed. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control does not
adapt driving speed based on road and driving
conditions.

To Use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
To initiate Traffic-Aware Cruise Control when no vehicle
is detected ahead of you, you must be driving at least
18 mph (30 km/h), unless certain vehicle and
environmental conditions are met, in which case, you
may be able to initiate it at lower speeds. If a vehicle is

1. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Autosteer Activation
and choose Double Click to allow you to use TrafficAware Cruise Control independently of Autosteer
when you single press the right scroll wheel.
NOTE: If Autosteer Activation is set to single-click,
pressing the right scroll wheel once also activates
Autosteer (which includes Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control).
2. You can choose whether Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
engages at the currently detected speed limit or your
current driving speed. Touch Controls > Autopilot >
Set Speed and choose either Speed Limit or Current
Speed. If you choose to engage Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control at the currently detected speed limit, you can
specify an offset. Touch Set Speed Offset. You can
choose a Fixed offset, in which the cruising speed
adjusts by a specific number of mph (km/h) on all
roads, or a Percentage offset, in which the cruising
speed is adjusted as a percentage of the road's
detected speed limit.
WARNING: When cruising at the speed limit,
there may be situations where the cruising
speed may not change when the speed limit
changes.
WARNING: Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control or Speed Assist to determine an
accurate or appropriate cruising speed. It is the
driver's responsibility to cruise at a safe speed
based on road conditions and applicable speed
limits.
3. To engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, press the
right scroll wheel.
NOTE: If the setting for Autosteer Activation is set to
Single Click (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autosteer
Activation), Autosteer engages.

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
4. To change your speed while using Traffic-Aware
Cruise Control, you can roll the right scroll wheel on
the steering wheel up or down. For more details, see
Changing the Cruising Speed on page 114.

You can manually accelerate at any time when cruising
at a set speed, but when you release the accelerator,
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control resumes cruising at the set
speed.

5. To cancel Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, press the right
scroll wheel, or press the brake pedal. See Canceling
and Resuming on page 116 for more information.

NOTE: When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is actively
slowing down Model X to maintain the selected distance
from the vehicle ahead, brake lights turn on to alert
other road users that you are slowing down. You may
notice slight movement of the brake pedal. However,
when Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is accelerating
Model X, the accelerator pedal does not move.

Set Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
Chime
If you want a chime to sound when you engage or
cancel Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, touch Controls >
Autopilot > Traffic-Aware Cruise Control Chime.
NOTE: Model X must be in Park.

Changing the Cruising Speed
Roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to
decrease, the set speed. Slowly rolling the scroll wheel
changes the set speed in 1 mph (1 km/h) increments and
quickly rolling the scroll wheel changes the set speed to
the closest 5 mph (5 km/h) increment. For example, if
you are traveling at 57 mph and quickly roll the scroll
wheel, the speed increases to 60 mph.

NOTE: It may take a few seconds for Model X to reach
the new cruising speed, assuming Model X is not
cruising behind a vehicle that is driving slower than your
set speed.

Cruising at the Set Speed
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control maintains your set cruising
speed whenever a vehicle is not detected in front of
Model X. When cruising behind a detected vehicle,
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control accelerates and decelerates
Model X as needed to maintain a chosen following
distance (see Adjust the Following Distance on page
115), up to the set speed.

WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may
occasionally cause Model X to brake when not
required or when you are not expecting it. This can
be caused by closely following a vehicle ahead,
detecting vehicles or objects in adjacent lanes
(especially on curves), etc.
WARNING: Due to limitations inherent in the
onboard GPS (Global Positioning System), you
may experience situations in which Model X slows
down, especially near exits or off-ramps where a
curve is detected and/or you are navigating to a
destination and not following the route.
WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not
detect all objects and, especially when cruising
over 50 mph (80 km/h), may not brake/decelerate
when a vehicle or object is only partially in the
driving lane or when a vehicle you are following
moves out of your driving path and a stationary or
slow-moving vehicle or object is in front of you.
Always pay attention to the road ahead and stay
prepared to take immediate corrective action.
Depending on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to
avoid a collision can result in serious injury or
death. In addition, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
may react to vehicles or objects that either do not
exist, or are not in your lane of travel, causing
Model X to slow down unnecessarily or
inappropriately.
WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may be
unable to provide adequate speed control because
of limited braking capability and hills. It can also
misjudge the distance from a vehicle ahead.
Driving downhill can increase driving speed,
causing Model X to exceed your set speed (and
potentially the road's speed limit). Never depend
on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to slow down
Model X enough to prevent a collision. Always
keep your eyes on the road when driving and be
prepared to take corrective action as needed.
Depending on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to
reduce your driving speed enough to prevent a
collision can result in serious injury or death.

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control also adjusts the cruising
speed when entering and exiting curves.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
HOLD State
When following a vehicle, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
remains active at low speeds, even when Model X comes
to a full stop. When the vehicle is moving again, TrafficAware Cruise Control resumes operating at the set
speed. However, under the following circumstances,
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control goes into a HOLD state, in
which case, you need to briefly press the accelerator
pedal to resume cruising. When the HOLD status is
active, the instrument panel displays the HOLD icon and
a message that indicates that you need to resume cruise
control. The following circumstances can cause TrafficAware Cruise Control to go into the HOLD state:
• Model X has been at a standstill for 5 minutes.
• Model X detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may
clear when the pedestrian is no longer detected).
• Model X suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in
front of you.
• An obstacle is detected in front of Model X.

Cruising Near or On Exits
When cruising near an exit on a controlled-access
highway and engaging the turn signal toward the offramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control assumes you are
exiting and begins to slow down Model X. If you do not
drive onto the off-ramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
resumes cruising at the set speed. In a region with right
hand traffic, this occurs only when you engage the right
turn signal when driving in the right-most lane within
164 feet (50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions with
left hand traffic; when engaging the left turn signal when
driving in the left-most lane within 164 feet (50 meters)
of an exit.
When cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access
highway, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control automatically
adjusts the set cruising speed to the speed limit of the
highway, plus any offset you have specified.
NOTE: The on-board Global Positioning System (GPS)
determines if you are driving in a region with right or left
hand traffic. In situations where GPS data is unavailable
(for example, if there is inadequate signal), engaging the
turn signal near an exit does not cause Traffic-Aware
Cruise Control to slow down Model X.
When enabled while on a highway interchange or offramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set
speed in 5 mph (5 km/h) increments – to as slow as
25 mph (40 km/h) – to better match the reported
speeds of other Tesla vehicles that have driven at that
specific location. To override this and continue cruising
at your set speed, tap the accelerator pedal. The new set
speed is maintained for the duration of the interchange
or off-ramp (unless you override it or cancel TrafficAware Cruise Control). After the interchange or offramp, the set speed may revert or change as necessary

Autopilot

based on the new location. For example, if you merged
onto a different highway, the set cruising speed reverts
to what it was before driving on the interchange.
WARNING: In some cases (such as having
insufficient data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may
not automatically reduce the set speed on the
highway interchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to determine an
appropriate driving speed. Tesla recommends
driving at a speed that is safe for road conditions
and within posted speed limits.

Adjust the Following Distance
To adjust the following distance you want to maintain
between Model X and a vehicle traveling ahead of you,
touch Controls > Autopilot > Cruise Follow Distance.
Each setting corresponds to a time-based distance that
represents how long it takes for Model X, from its
current location, to reach the location of the rear
bumper of the vehicle ahead of you. Your setting is
retained until you manually change it.
The closest following distance is 2.
WARNING: It is the driver's responsibility to
determine and maintain a safe following distance
at all times. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control to maintain an accurate or appropriate
following distance.
WARNING: Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control to adequately slow down Model X to avoid
a collision. Always watch the road in front of you
and stay prepared to take immediate corrective
action.

Overtake Acceleration
When following a vehicle with Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control active, engaging the turn signal (to indicate a
move into the passing lane) accelerates Model X towards
the vehicle ahead. By momentarily holding the turn
signal, you can quickly accelerate up to your set speed
without having to press the accelerator pedal. The turn
signal causes acceleration only when all of the following
conditions are met:
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is operating and detects
a vehicle in front of you.
• No obstacles or vehicles are detected in the target
lane.
• Model X is traveling below the set speed, but over
45 mph (72 km/h).
Overtake Acceleration is intended as an aid when
passing a vehicle ahead of you. When the turn signal is
engaged, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control continues to
maintain distance from the vehicle ahead, but allows you
to drive slightly closer than your selected distance.

115

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
Acceleration cancels when one of the conditions
happen:
• You reach your set cruising speed.
• Changing lanes takes too long.
• Model X gets too close to the vehicle ahead.
OR
• You disengage the turn signal.
NOTE: Overtake Acceleration occurs when you fully
press and hold the turn signal. When you release the
turn signal, Model X stops accelerating (in the same way
as when you release the accelerator pedal) and resumes
the set speed.
WARNING: Overtake Acceleration can cancel for
many unforeseen reasons in addition to those
listed above (for example, lack of GPS data). Stay
alert and never depend on Overtake Acceleration
to increase your driving speed.
WARNING: Overtake Acceleration increases your
driving speed whenever the appropriate turn
signal is engaged, and accelerates Model X closer
to the vehicle ahead. Although Traffic-Aware
Cruise Control continues to maintain distance from
the vehicle ahead, it is important to be aware that
your selected following distance is reduced when
Overtake Acceleration is active, particularly in
cases where it may not be your intention to
overtake the vehicle you are following.

Canceling and Resuming
To manually cancel Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, press
the brake pedal or press the right scroll wheel on the
steering yoke (or steering wheel).
To resume cruising, press the right scroll button.
NOTE: When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels,
Model X does not coast. Instead, regenerative braking
slows down Model X in the same way as when you move
your foot off the accelerator when driving without
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (see Regenerative Braking
on page 87).
WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels,
or may not be available, in the following situations:
• You press the brake pedal.
• Your driving speed exceeds the maximum cruising
speed of 90 mph (150 km/h).
• You shift Model X.

• The wheels are spinning while at a standstill.
• The Traffic-Aware Cruise Control system is failing or
requires service.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is unavailable or
cancels, Model X no longer drives consistently at a set
speed and no longer maintains a specified distance from
the vehicle ahead.
WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control can cancel
unexpectedly at any time for unforeseen reasons.
Always watch the road in front of you and stay
prepared to take appropriate action. It is the
driver's responsibility to be in control of Model X at
all times.

Summary of Cruise Indicators
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is available
but is not actively controlling your speed
until you activate it. The number shown in
gray is the cruising speed that will be set
when you engage Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control.
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is actively
cruising and is either maintaining the set
speed (no vehicle in front) or is
maintaining a chosen following distance
from a vehicle ahead (up to the set speed).
Model X has fully stopped but is in a HOLD
state. If safe, press the accelerator pedal to
resume cruising at the set speed.

Limitations
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is particularly unlikely to
operate as intended in the following types of situations:
• The road has sharp curves.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or
direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the
camera(s).
• A camera or sensor (if equipped) is obstructed
(fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).
WARNING: The list above does not represent an
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with
proper operation of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.

• A door is opened.
• A camera or sensor (if equipped) is obstructed. This
could be caused by dirt, mud, ice, snow, fog, etc.
• The traction control setting is manually disabled or is
repeatedly engaging to prevent wheels from slipping.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Autosteer
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Autosteer, or the
feature may not operate exactly as described.
NOTE: Autosteer is a BETA feature.
Autosteer builds upon Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (see
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on page 113), intelligently
keeping Model X in its driving lane when cruising at a set
speed. Autosteer also allows you to use the turn signals
to move Model X into an adjacent lane (see Auto Lane
Change on page 119). Autosteer detects lane markings
and the presence of vehicles and objects to steer
Model X.
NOTE: To display more details about the roadway and its
surroundings, such as road markings, stop lights, objects
(such as trash cans and poles), etc., touch Controls >
Autopilot > Full Self-Driving Visualization Preview (if
equipped).
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as
well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, affect performance.
WARNING: Autosteer is a hands-on feature. You
must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or
steering wheel) at all times.
WARNING: Autosteer is intended for use on
controlled-access highways with a fully attentive
driver. When using Autosteer, hold the steering
yoke (or steering wheel) and be mindful of road
conditions and surrounding traffic. Do not use
Autosteer in construction zones, or in areas where
bicyclists or pedestrians may be present. Never
depend on Autosteer to determine an appropriate
driving path. Always be prepared to take
immediate action. Failure to follow these
instructions could cause damage, serious injury or
death.

Operating Autosteer
Before you can operate Autosteer, you must enable it by
touching Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features >
Autosteer (Beta).
To indicate that Autosteer is available (but
not actively steering Model X), the
instrument panel displays a gray Autosteer
icon.

Steering yoke option

To initiate Autosteer, press the right scroll wheel.

Autopilot

NOTE: If the setting for Autosteer Activation is set to
Single Click (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autosteer
Activation), Autosteer engages when you single-press
the right scroll wheel. If set to Double Click, you must
double-press the right scroll wheel to engage Autosteer.
To indicate that Autosteer is now actively
steering Model X, the instrument panel
displays the Autosteer icon in blue. When
Autosteer is able to detect lane markings,
it also displays the driving lane in blue.
Steering yoke option

Autosteer briefly displays a message on the instrument
panel reminding you to pay attention to the road and be
ready to take over at any time.
The speed at which you can initiate Autosteer can vary
depending on various conditions and whether or not a
vehicle is detected ahead of you. When no vehicle is
detected ahead of you, you must be driving at least
18 mph (30 km/h), unless certain vehicle and
environmental conditions are met, in which case, you
may be able to initiate it at lower speeds. When a
vehicle is detected ahead of you, you can initiate
Autosteer at any speed, even when stationary, provided
Model X is at least 5 feet (150 cm) behind the detected
vehicle.
NOTE: When Autosteer is engaged, Auto High Beam is
automatically enabled and the maximum cruising speed
is 85 mph (140 km/h).
CAUTION: If available in your market region,
Model X detects lights from an emergency vehicle
when using Autosteer at night on a high speed
road, the driving speed is automatically reduced
and the instrument panel displays a message
informing you of the slowdown. You will also hear
a chime and see a reminder to keep your hands on
the steering yoke (or steering wheel). When the
light detections pass by or cease to appear,
Autopilot resumes your cruising speed.
Alternatively, you may tap the accelerator to
resume your cruising speed.
WARNING: Never depend on Autopilot features to
determine the presence of emergency vehicles.
Model X may not detect lights from emergency
vehicles. Keep your eyes on your driving path and
always be prepared to take immediate action.
In situations where Autosteer is temporarily unavailable,
the Autosteer icon disappears. For example, your driving
speed is not within the speed required for Autosteer to
operate. Autosteer may also be unavailable if it is not
receiving adequate data from the camera(s).

117

Autosteer
NOTE: In low light conditions (dusk or dark), Autosteer
aborts or is unavailable if headlights are set to Off. For
best results, set headlights to Auto.
If unable to detect lane markings, Autosteer may
determine the driving lane based on a vehicle you are
following.
In most cases, Autosteer attempts to center Model X in
the driving lane. However, there may be situations in
which Autosteer may steer Model X in a driving path
that is offset from the center of the lane (for example,
detection of guard rails).
WARNING: Autosteer is not designed to, and will
not, steer Model X around objects partially in a
driving lane and in some cases, may not stop for
objects that are completely blocking the driving
lane. Always watch the road in front of you and
stay prepared to take immediate action. It is the
driver's responsibility to be in control of Model X at
all times.

Restricted Speed
On a controlled-access highway, the cruising speed
reflects the speed limit, taking into consideration any
offset you've specified using Speed Assist. However, if
you choose to use Autosteer on residential roads, a road
without a center divider, or a road where access is not
limited, Autosteer may limit the maximum allowed
cruising speed and the instrument panel displays a
message indicating that speed is restricted. The
restricted speed will be the speed limit of the road plus
5 mph (10 km/h).
In situations where the speed limit cannot be detected
when Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer reduces your
driving speed and limits the set cruising speed to 45
mph (70 km/h). Although you can manually accelerate
to exceed the limited speed, Model X may not brake for
detected obstacles. Autosteer slows down to the limited
speed when you release the accelerator pedal. When
you leave the road, or disengage Autosteer by using the
steering yoke (or steering wheel), you can increase your
set speed again, if desired.

Hold Steering Yoke (or Steering Wheel)
Autosteer determines how best to steer Model X. When
active, Autosteer requires you to hold the steering yoke
(or steering wheel). If it does not detect your hands on
the steering yoke (or steering wheel) for a period of
time, a flashing light appears along the top of the
instrument panel and the following message displays:

Steering wheel alert:
Apply slight turning force to steering
wheel

Autosteer detects your hands by recognizing slight
resistance as the steering yoke (or steering wheel) turns,
or from you manually turning the steering yoke (or
steering wheel) very lightly (without enough force to
take over steering). Autosteer also qualifies your hands
as being detected if you engage a turn signal or use a
button or scroll wheel on the steering yoke (or steering
wheel).
NOTE: When your hands are detected, the message
disappears and Autosteer resumes normal operation.
Autosteer requires that you pay attention to your
surroundings and remain prepared to take control at any
time. If Autosteer still does not detect your hands on the
steering yoke (or steering wheel), the flashing light on
the instrument panel increases in frequency and a chime
sounds.
If you repeatedly ignore Autosteer's prompts to apply
slight force to the steering yoke (or steering wheel),
Autosteer disables for the rest of the drive and displays
the following message requesting you to drive manually.
If you don't resume manual steering, Autosteer sounds a
continuous chime, turns on the warning flashers, and
slows the vehicle to a complete stop.
Autosteer unavailable for the rest of this
drive. Hold steering yoke (or steering
wheel) to drive manually.

For the rest of the drive, you must steer manually.
Autosteer is available again on your next drive (after you
stop and shift Model X into Park).

Take Over Immediately
In situations where Autosteer is unable to steer Model X,
Autosteer sounds a warning chime and displays the
following message on the instrument panel:
Take over immediately

Steering yoke alert:
Apply slight turning force to steering yoke

118

When you see this message, TAKE OVER STEERING
IMMEDIATELY.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Autosteer
Canceling Autosteer
Autosteer cancels when:
• You press the brake pedal.
• You start steering manually.
• You exceed the maximum speed at which Autosteer
operates – 90 mph (150 km/h).
• You shift.
• A door is opened.
• An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see
Collision Avoidance Assist on page 145).
When Autosteer cancels, it sounds a chime and the
Autosteer icon either turns gray to indicate that
Autosteer is no longer active, or disappears to indicate
that it is not currently available.
WARNING: If Autosteer Activation is set to Double
Click and Autosteer cancels because you started
steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
remains active. If Autosteer Activation is set to
Single Click and Autosteer cancels because you
started steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control also cancels.
To disable Autosteer so it is no longer available, touch
Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer
(Beta).

Auto Lane Change
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Auto Lane
Change, or the feature may not operate exactly as
described.
When Autosteer is active, engage a turn signal to move
Model X into an adjacent lane (moving the steering yoke
(or steering wheel) would cancel Autosteer).
WARNING: It is the driver's responsibility to
determine whether a lane change is safe and
appropriate. Therefore, before initiating a lane
change, always check blind spots, lane markings,
and the surrounding roadway to confirm it is safe
and appropriate to move into the target lane.
WARNING: Never depend on Auto Lane Change to
determine an appropriate driving path. Drive
attentively by watching the road and traffic ahead
of you, checking the surrounding area, and
monitoring the instrument panel for warnings.
Always be prepared to take immediate action.
WARNING: Do not use Auto Lane Change on roads
where traffic conditions are constantly changing
and where bicycles and pedestrians are present.

Autopilot

WARNING: The performance of Auto Lane Change
depends on the ability of the camera(s) to
recognize lane markings.
WARNING: Do not use Auto Lane Change on
winding roads with sharp curves, on icy or slippery
roads, or when weather conditions (such as heavy
rain, snow, fog, etc.) may be obstructing the view
from the camera(s) or sensors (if equipped).
WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and
instructions can result in property damage, serious
injury or death.

Operating Auto Lane Change
Auto Lane Change is available whenever Autosteer is
active. To change lanes using Auto Lane Change:
1. Perform visual checks to make sure it is safe and
appropriate to move into the target lane.
2. Engage the appropriate turn signal, keeping your
hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel).
3. If needed, cancel the turn signal once you are in the
target lane.
NOTE: The minimum speed at which Auto Lane Change
operates may vary depending on region, adjacent lane
speeds, and other factors. Always be ready to manually
steer and change lanes as necessary.
Auto Lane Change moves Model X into the adjacent lane
in the direction indicated by the turn signal, provided
the following conditions are met:
• The turn signal is engaged.
• Model X does not detect a vehicle in its blind spot, or
a vehicle or obstacle up to the center of the target
lane.
• Lane markings indicate that a lane change is
permitted.
• Midway through the lane change, Model X must
detect the target lane's outside lane marking. If this
lane marking is not detected, the lane change is
aborted and Model X returns to its original driving
lane.
• The view of the camera(s) is not obstructed.
When an automatic lane change is in progress, Overtake
Acceleration is activated, allowing Model X to accelerate
closer to a vehicle in front (see Overtake Acceleration on
page 115).
NOTE: Auto Lane Change moves Model X one lane at a
time. Moving into an additional lane requires you to
engage the turn signal a second time after the first lane
change is complete.

119

Autosteer
When using Auto Lane Change, it is important to
monitor its performance by watching the driving path in
front of you and the surrounding area. Stay prepared to
take over steering at any time. As you are crossing over
into the adjacent lane, the instrument panel displays the
location in the lane that Model X is moving into.
In situations where Auto Lane Change is unable to
operate at optimal performance, or cannot operate due
to inadequate data, the instrument panel displays a
series of warnings. Therefore, when using Auto Lane
Change, always pay attention to the instrument panel
and be prepared to manually steer Model X.

Adjacent Lane Speed
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Adjacent Lane
Speed, or the feature may not operate exactly as
described.

Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Stop Light and
Stop Sign Warning, or the feature may not operate
exactly as described.
While Autosteer is in use, Model X displays a warning on
the instrument panel and sounds a chime if it detects
that you are likely to run through a red stop light or stop
sign. If this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE
ACTION!
The visual and audible warnings cancel after a few
seconds, or when you press the brake pedal, whichever
comes first.
Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning provides warnings
only. It does not slow down or stop Model X at red traffic
lights, stop signs, road markings, etc. If equipped with
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you can enable this
feature to automatically stop Model X at traffic lights
and stop signs (see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
on page 125).
CAUTION: Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning
requires on-board maps to know that a particular
stop light or stop sign exists at a location. In some
cases, map data is inaccurate or outdated and may
not include all stop lights or stop signs. Therefore,
Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning may not detect
all stop lights and stop signs.

When moving significantly faster than vehicles in
adjacent lanes, Model X automatically reduces the
driving speed. This is especially helpful in heavy traffic
situations or when vehicles are constantly merging into
different lanes. When Model X detects other vehicles
driving significantly slower, the instrument panel
highlights the adjacent lanes with arrows and detected
vehicles in gray, and Model X reduces the driving speed
as appropriate. To temporarily override this feature,
press the accelerator pedal.
WARNING: Never depend on Autopilot to
determine a safe driving speed; you are
responsible for driving safely and according to
traffic laws in your market region.

WARNING: The Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning
feature does not apply the brakes or decelerate
Model X and may not detect all stop lights and
stop signs. Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning is
designed for guidance purposes only and is not a
substitute for attentive driving and sound
judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when
driving and never depend on Stop Light and Stop
Sign Warning to warn you of a stop light or stop
sign.
WARNING: Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning is
designed to warn you only when approaching a
visible red stop sign, solid red or later portion of a
yellow traffic light. It may not warn you of
intersections with flashing lights and it does not
warn you of yield signs or temporary stop and
yield signs (such as those used in construction
areas). Additionally, Stop Light and Stop Sign
Warning does not warn you of approaching stop
lights or stop signs when you are pressing the
accelerator pedal or brake pedal (which disables
Autosteer).

Limitations
Autosteer and its associated functions are particularly
unlikely to operate as intended when:

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Autosteer
• Autosteer is unable to accurately determine lane
markings. For example, lane markings are excessively
worn, have visible previous markings, have been
adjusted due to road construction, are changing
quickly (lanes branching off, crossing over, or
merging), objects or landscape features are casting
strong shadows on the lane markings, or the road
surface contains pavement seams or other highcontrast lines.
• Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or
weather conditions are interfering with sensor
operation.
• A camera(s) or sensor(s) is obstructed, covered, or
damaged.
• Driving on hills.
• Approaching a toll booth.
• Driving on a road that has sharp curves or is
excessively rough.
• Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering
with the view of the camera(s).
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other
electrical equipment or devices that generate
ultrasonic waves.
• A vehicle is detected in your blind spot when you
engage the turn signal.
• Model X is being driven very close to a vehicle in
front of it, which is blocking the view of the
camera(s).
WARNING: Many unforeseen circumstances can
impair the operation of Autosteer. Always keep this
in mind and remember that as a result, Autosteer
may not steer Model X appropriately. Always drive
attentively and be prepared to take immediate
action.

Autopilot

121

Navigate on Autopilot
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Navigate on
Autopilot, or the feature may not operate exactly as
described.
NOTE: Navigate on Autopilot is a BETA feature.
When using Autosteer on a controlled-access highway
(a main highway on which road users enter and exit
using on-ramps and off-ramps). Navigate on Autopilot
guides Model X to off-ramps and interchanges based on
your navigation route. Along the highway portion of a
navigation route, Navigate on Autopilot also changes
lanes to prepare for exits (route-based lane changes)
and to minimize the driving time to your destination
(speed-based lane changes).
WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot does not make
driving autonomous. You must pay attention to the
road, keep your hands on the steering yoke (or
steering wheel) at all times, and remain aware of
your navigation route.
WARNING: As is the case with normal driving, be
extra careful around blind corners, interchanges,
and on-ramps and off-ramps - obstacles can
appear quickly and at any time.
WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot may not
recognize or detect oncoming vehicles, stationary
objects, and special-use lanes such as those used
exclusively for bikes, carpools, emergency vehicles,
etc. Remain alert at all times and be prepared to
take immediate action. Failure to do so can cause
damage, injury or death.

Enabling and Customizing Navigate
on Autopilot
To enable Navigate on Autopilot, touch Controls >
Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer > Navigate
on Autopilot (Beta). Then, to customize how you want
Navigate on Autopilot to operate, touch Customize
Navigate on Autopilot:
• Enable At Start Of Every Trip: Choose whether or not
you want to automatically enable Navigate on
Autopilot for every navigation route. When enabled,
the Navigate on Autopilot button on the turn-by-turn
direction list is already enabled at the start of every
trip.
• Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot is
designed to perform both route-based and speedbased lane changes. Route-based lane changes are
designed to keep you on your navigation route (for
example, moving you into an adjacent lane to prepare
for an upcoming off-ramp) whereas speed-based
lane changes are designed to maintain a driving
speed (not to exceed your cruising speed) that allows
you to minimize the time it takes to reach your
destination (for example, moving into an adjacent
lane to pass a vehicle in front of you). Speed-based
lanes changes are optional. You can use this setting
122

to disable speed-based lane changes or to specify
how aggressively you want Navigate on Autopilot to
change lanes to achieve the set cruising speed. The
Mild setting is more conservative about lane changes
and may result in a slightly longer driving time
whereas Mad Max is designed to allow you to reach
your destination in the shortest driving time possible,
but changes lanes only when safe to do so.
• Exit Passing Lane: Choose whether you want
Navigate on Autopilot to maneuver out of a passing
lane when navigating to a destination.
NOTE: In addition to route-based and speed-based
lane changes, Navigate on Autopilot requests a lane
change out of a passing lane as a reminder to stay in
a slower lane when you are not passing other
vehicles. Choose NO to disable this and keep Model X
in a passing lane except when needed to stay on the
navigation route.
• Require Lane Change Confirmation (if equipped): By
default, Navigate on Autopilot requires your
confirmation before proceeding with a lane change
by pressing the appropriate turn signal. However, if
you want Navigate on Autopilot to change lanes
without requiring this confirmation, turn this setting
off. When you turn the setting off, you can specify if
or how you want to be notified of lane changes (Off,
Chime, Vibrate, or Both).
WARNING: If you turn off Require Lane Change
Confirmation, Navigate on Autopilot notifies
you of upcoming lane changes and off-ramps,
but it remains your responsibility to monitor the
environment and maintain control of Model X at
all times. Lane changes can occur quickly and
suddenly. Always keep your hands on the wheel
and your eyes on the driving path in front of
you.
NOTE: The touchscreen displays route-based lane
changes at the top of the map's turn-by-turn direction
list to notify you that an upcoming lane change is
needed to stay on the navigation route.

Operating Navigate on Autopilot
Once enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button appears
on the map’s turn-by-turn direction list whenever a
navigation route is active and the route includes at least
one controlled-access highway. When enabled, the
Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the turn-byturn direction displays the Autosteer icon next to the
maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on
Autopilot will handle.
NOTE: If Enable At Start Of Every Trip is turned off, you
must touch the Navigate on Autopilot button to enable
it for each navigation route.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Navigate on Autopilot
Navigate on Autopilot activates and deactivates as
appropriate, based on the type of road you are driving
on. For example, if Autosteer is active and Navigate on
Autopilot is enabled, Navigate on Autopilot
automatically becomes active when you reach a
controlled-access highway on your navigation route.
Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the
instrument panel displays the driving lane as a single
blue line in front of Model X:

WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot may not always
attempt to exit at an off-ramp or change lanes,
even when an exit or lane change is determined by
the navigation route. Always remain alert and be
prepared to manually steer onto an off-ramp, or
make a lane change to prepare for, or to exit at, an
off-ramp or interchange.
You can cancel Navigate on Autopilot at any time by
touching Navigate on Autopilot on the map’s turn-byturn direction list (Model X reverts to Autosteer), or by
canceling Autosteer entirely (see Canceling Autosteer
on page 119).

Lane Changes
Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to either prepare
Model X for an upcoming off-ramp, to increase your
driving speed (not to exceed your set cruising speed), or
to move Model X out of a passing lane when you are not
actively passing other road users. A message displays at
the top of the map's turn-by-turn direction list to notify
you when an upcoming lane change is required to stay
on your navigation route. The instrument panel displays
the upcoming driving path:

When Navigate on Autopilot is active and you approach
an off-ramp or interchange along your navigation route,
the appropriate turn signal engages and Autosteer
maneuvers Model X onto the off-ramp or interchange.
WARNING: Never depend on Navigate on
Autopilot to determine an appropriate lane at an
off-ramp. Stay alert and perform visual checks to
ensure that the driving lane is safe and
appropriate.
When you leave a controlled-access highway (for
example, you take an exit or you enter a section of the
navigation route that is no longer supported), Navigate
on Autopilot reverts to Autosteer— a chime sounds and
the instrument panel displays the driving lane lines in
blue (instead of the single blue in front of Model X).
NOTE: When determining navigation routes, and
maneuvers at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot
considers whether or not you want to use High
Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. Therefore, ensure the
Use HOV Lanes setting is appropriate for your
circumstances (see Maps and Navigation on page 165). If
the setting is off, Navigate on Autopilot never uses a
HOV lane, regardless of time of day. If the setting is on,
Navigate on Autopilot uses HOV lanes, whenever
applicable.
WARNING: When Navigate on Autopilot
deactivates, Autosteer remains active. Always be
prepared to take appropriate action.

Autopilot

If Require Lane Change Confirmation is turned off,
Navigate on Autopilot engages the appropriate turn
signal, checks for vehicles and objects, and when
appropriate, maneuvers Model X into the adjacent lane.
If Require Lane Change Confirmation is turned on, you
must engage the appropriate turn signal to confirm that
you want Navigate on Autopilot to proceed with the
lane change. If you do not confirm the lane change
within three seconds, a chime sounds to remind you that
Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation to
change lanes.
NOTE: If you ignore a route-based lane change
suggestion (for example, you are driving in the left lane
while approaching an off-ramp on the right side of the
highway), Navigate on Autopilot is unable to maneuver
onto the off-ramp and as a result, you are re-routed to
your destination.

123

Navigate on Autopilot
WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot may not always
attempt to exit at an off-ramp or change lanes,
even when an exit or lane change is determined by
the navigation route. Always remain alert and be
prepared to manually steer onto an off-ramp, or
make a lane change to prepare for, or to exit at, an
off-ramp or interchange.

Be Ready to Assist
When attempting to change lanes or maneuver Model X,
or when approaching construction zones, Navigate on
Autopilot may be unable to determine the appropriate
driving lane (for example, complex clover leafs and
multi-lane off-ramps) and the instrument panel displays
an alert indicating that Navigate on Autopilot is trying to
maneuver and may require assistance. When you see the
message, be prepared to take immediate action to
ensure that it is safe and appropriate to complete the
lane change or maneuver.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Traffic Light and
Stop Sign Control, or the feature may not operate
exactly as described.
NOTE: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is a BETA
feature and works best on roads that are frequently
driven by Tesla vehicles. Traffic Light and Stop Sign
Control attempts to stop at all traffic lights and may also
stop at green lights.
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to
recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs,
slowing Model X to a stop when using Traffic-Aware
cruise control or Autosteer. This feature uses the
vehicle's forward-facing cameras, in addition to GPS
data, and slows the car for all detected traffic lights,
including green, blinking yellow, and off lights in addition
to stop signs and some road markings. As Model X
approaches an intersection, the instrument panel
displays a notification indicating the intention to slow
down. You must confirm that you want to continue or
Model X stops at the red line displayed on the
instrument panel's driving visualization.
WARNING: NEVER make assumptions and predict
when and where Traffic Light and Stop Sign
Control will stop or continue through an
intersection or road marking. From a driver's
perspective, the behavior of Traffic Light and Stop
Sign Control may appear inconsistent. Always pay
attention to the roadway and be prepared to take
immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to
determine whether to stop or continue through an
intersection. Never depend on Traffic Light and
Stop Sign Control to determine when it is safe
and/or appropriate to stop or continue through an
intersection.

Before Using
Before using Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you
must:
• Ensure that forward-facing cameras are unobstructed
(see Cleaning a Camera on page 199) and calibrated
(see Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 111). Traffic
Light and Stop Sign Control depends on the ability of
the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, and
road markings.
• Ensure that the latest version of maps has been
downloaded to Model X. Although Traffic Light and
Stop Sign Control primarily uses visual data received
from the vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is
achieved when using the most recent map data. To
check which version of maps is currently
downloaded, touch Controls > Software. You must
connect to a Wi-Fi network to receive updated maps
(see Map Updates on page 170).

Autopilot

• Enable the feature. With the vehicle in Park, touch
Controls > Autopilot > Traffic Light and Stop Sign
Control. Once enabled, Traffic Light and Stop Sign
Control operates whenever Traffic-Aware Cruise
Control or Autosteer is active.

How it Works
When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is enabled and
you are using Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control,
the instrument panel displays a popup message to
inform you that an upcoming traffic light, stop sign, or
road marking has been detected. As it approaches the
stop location, even at an intersection where the traffic
light is green, Model X slows down and displays a red
line to indicate where Model X will stop. To continue
through the intersection—even if the traffic light is green
—you must briefly press the accelerator pedal to give
the vehicle permission to proceed. When you've
confirmed that you want to proceed, the red stop line
turns gray and Model X continues through the
intersection and resumes your set cruising speed.
NOTE: If Model X is approaching a green light and
detects that a vehicle in front of you is continuing
through the intersection, Model X continues through the
intersection without requiring your confirmation,
provided you are not in a turning lane and the vehicle
can detect that your hands are on the steering yoke (or
steering wheel).
NOTE: If, after you briefly press the accelerator pedal to
confirm that you want to continue through the
intersection, the traffic signal changes before you enter
the intersection (for example, the light changes from
green to yellow or from yellow to red), Model X may
determine that it is not appropriate to proceed.
Therefore, Model X stops and you must press the
accelerator to proceed. At all times, it is your
responsibility to ensure the vehicle stops or accelerates
appropriately and safely.
WARNING: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
DOES NOT turn Model X through an intersection.
When in a turning lane, Model X stops at the red
stop line. To proceed, briefly press the accelerator
pedal—Model X continues straight through the
intersection (even when in a turning lane), so you
MUST manually steer Model X through the
intersection (which cancels Autosteer).
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to
operate as described only when the following conditions
are met:
• Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is engaged.
• The cameras can detect an upcoming traffic light,
stop sign or road marking (for example, cameras are
unobstructed and have a clear line-of-sight to the
traffic light, stop sign, or road marking).

125

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
• The instrument panel on Model X is displaying an
upcoming traffic light in "bold" format. Model X does
not acknowledge traffic lights that the instrument
panel shows as faded. If a traffic light is not directly
ahead of the camera (for example, it is located at an
angle of the camera's view, or located in an adjacent
lane) the instrument panel displays it as faded and
Model X does not slow down and stop for it.

WARNING: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is
not a substitute for attentive driving and sound
judgment.

WARNING: If the instrument panel is not
displaying a red stop line at an upcoming
intersection, Model X does not slow down or stop.
It is the driver's responsibility to pay attention to
upcoming intersections and monitor traffic
conditions to determine when and if the vehicle
should stop and then to take appropriate action as
needed.
WARNING: Never depend on Traffic Light and
Stop Sign Control to determine whether to stop at,
or proceed through, an intersection. Drive
attentively by watching the road and paying
attention to the roadway, upcoming intersections,
traffic conditions, crosswalks, and other road users.
It is always the driver's responsibility to determine
whether to stop or proceed. Be prepared to take
immediate action. Failure to do so can result in
injury or death.
WARNING: In some situations, Traffic Light and
Stop Sign Control may inaccurately detect a traffic
light or stop sign, causing Model X to slow down
unexpectedly. Be prepared to take immediate
action at all times.
WARNING: You must briefly press the accelerator
pedal to confirm that you want to proceed through
an intersection, regardless of the status of the
traffic light. If you do not confirm, Model X stops at
the red stop line displayed on the instrument
panel, even if stopping may be inappropriate.
Stopping at a green light may confuse other
drivers and may result in a collision, injury or
death. Therefore, always pay attention to
upcoming intersections and be prepared to
manually brake or accelerate in response to
surroundings.
WARNING: Never assume that your ability to see a
traffic light, stop sign, or road marking (especially
at a complex intersection, or an intersection in
which a traffic light or sign is partially obstructed,
etc.) means that Model X can also see it and
respond appropriately.
WARNING: Even the most recent map data does
not include all traffic lights and stop signs.
Therefore, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
relies heavily on the ability of the cameras to
detect traffic lights, stop signs, road markings, etc.
As a result, Model X may ignore an intersection
that is blocked from the camera's view (for
example, obstructed by a tree or a large vehicle or
object, or located near a steep hill or sharp curve).

Traffic Lights
When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
enabled, Model X is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by a traffic light:
Type of Traffic Light

Vehicle Intended Response
At a solid green traffic light, or at a traffic light that is currently off (not
illuminated), Model X slows down.
If you are following a car in front of you that continues through the intersection,
the instrument panel displays a green stop line and provided your hands are
detected on the steering yoke (or steering wheel), Model X also continues. If a car
is not in front of you, the instrument panel displays a red stop line and you must
confirm that you want to continue through the intersection by briefly pressing the
accelerator pedal. If you don’t confirm, Model X stops at the red stop line.
NOTE: Model X resumes the set cruising speed when it continues through the
intersection, taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you.

Model X slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed
on the instrument panel. When you want to continue through the intersection (for
example, the light turns green again, or once Model X has come to a complete
stop), you must briefly press the accelerator pedal.

Model X slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed
on the instrument panel. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for
example, the light turns green again), you must briefly press the accelerator pedal.
NOTE: If the traffic light changes after you've confirmed that you want to proceed
(for example, a green traffic light turns yellow), Model X may stop instead of
continuing, especially if Model X determines that it can safely stop before entering
the intersection.
NOTE: Model X is not designed to proceed through an intersection when the traffic
light is red or if the light turns yellow in situations when there is adequate distance
to safely stop before entering the intersection.
NOTE: You can take over driving at any time by manually braking to cancel
Autosteer or Traffic-aware Cruise Control.

Model X slows down. To proceed, you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. If
you don’t, Model X stops at the red stop line displayed on the instrument panel.
NOTE: To prevent Model X from stopping, and to minimize how much it slows
down as it approaches, you can confirm that you want to proceed by briefly
pressing the accelerator pedal at any time after the instrument panel displays the
red stop line. Model X resumes your set cruising speed immediately after you
confirm (taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you).
WARNING: Approach attentively and be prepared to press the brake pedal to
slow down or stop.

Model X slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed

Arm of T-junction
If Model X detects a T-junction based on the map data, Model X slows down and
comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the instrument panel.
When you want to proceed, you must take over steering and acceleration.
WARNING: Model X may not stop at a T-junction that does not have a stop
sign or stop line, or if the T-junction is not included in the map data. Drive
attentively and be prepared to stop (when necessary and/or appropriate).

End of T-junction
Model X slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on
the instrument panel. When you want to proceed through the intersection, you must
briefly press the accelerator pedal.
NOTE: If you confirm that you want to proceed through an intersection controlled by
a stop sign by briefly pressing the accelerator pedal before Model X has stopped,
your confirmation is ignored. Model X is not designed to proceed through a stop
sign without stopping.
NOTE: Even when using Autosteer, and even if you have engaged a turn signal, you
must turn the steering yoke (or steering wheel) yourself (which cancels Autosteer)
to complete a turn at an intersection.

WARNING: Model X also slows down and stops at a roundabout. You must take over steering (which cancels
Autosteer) and briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to continue through the
roundabout.
WARNING: At crosswalks, Model X may slow down and may stop, depending on whether the crosswalk is
controlled by a traffic light and whether the cameras detect pedestrians, bicyclists, etc. in the crosswalk. Pay
particular attention at crosswalks and be prepared to take over at any time. Failure to do so can result in injury
or death.

Limitations
Depending on many different circumstances and environmental conditions, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may
or may not stop at:
• Railroad crossings.
• Keep-out zones.
• Toll booths.
• Crosswalk systems.
• Yield signs or temporary traffic lights and stop signs (such as at construction areas).
• Miscellaneous traffic U-turn lights, bicycle and pedestrian crossing lights, lane availability lights, etc.
In addition, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is particularly unlikely to operate as intended, can disengage, or may
not operate, when one or more of the following conditions are present:
• Driving through consecutive light-controlled intersections that are very close to each other.
• Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are interfering with camera or sensor
operation.

130

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control
• Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
• A camera is obstructed, covered, damaged, or not properly calibrated.
• Driving on a hill or on a road that has sharp curves on which the cameras are unable to see upcoming traffic lights
or stop signs.
• A traffic light, stop sign, or road marking is obstructed (for example, a tree, a large vehicle, etc.).
• Model X is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it, which is blocking the view of a camera.
WARNING: The limitations listed above are not an exhaustive list of reasons why Model X may not operate as
expected. Many unforeseen circumstances can adversely impact the accurate operation of Traffic Light and
Stop Sign Control. Using this feature does not reduce or eliminate the need to drive attentively and
responsibly. You must be prepared to take appropriate and immediate action at all times.

Full Self-Driving (Beta)
WARNING: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment
expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to
eligible customers in select countries outside the
United States. Because every country contains
unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic
patterns that Full Self-Driving (Beta) must adapt
to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full
Self-Driving (Beta) in newly eligible countries to be
extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be
ready to take over safely at any time.

The instrument panel displays a visualization of the
environment surrounding Model X, including the
roadway and detected objects such as vehicles,
pedestrians, curbs, etc.

Full Self-Driving (Beta) is an early access feature and
must be used with additional caution. When Full SelfDriving (Beta) is actively engaged, Model X attempts to
navigate to your destination, by following road curves,
adjusting speed for traffic, stopping at and negotiating
intersections, making turns, selecting forks, and
entering/exiting highways.
WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make
Model X autonomous and may not perform as
expected at all times – do not become complacent.
It requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to
take immediate action at all times. Full Self-Driving
(Beta) does not replace the driver’s responsibility
to operate Model X.
WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and
instructions can result in property damage, serious
injury or death.

Full Self-Driving (Beta) Settings
To enable Full Self-Driving (Beta), touch Controls >
Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Full Self-Driving
(Beta) and then, after carefully reading and
understanding the popup window, touch Yes.
If desired, change the setting for Full Self-Driving (Beta)
Profile from the default setting of Average to Chill or
Assertive. Chill provides a more relaxed driving style and
Assertive drives with more urgency.

How to Use Full Self-Driving (Beta)
1.
Engage Full Self-Driving (Beta): Enter a
destination (if desired) and when the
instrument panel displays the gray
steering yoke (or steering wheel) icon
indicating that Autosteer is available,
press the right scroll wheel. If you do
not enter a destination, Model X
chooses the most probable driving path
or suggests a destination based on your
driving.
When Full Self-Driving (Beta) is
engaged, the steering yoke (or steering
wheel) icon is blue and a blue line
represents your driving path.

132

2. Be ready to take over: There may be occasions where
driver intervention is required and you must take over
immediately to maintain safe driving. For example,
the vehicle may alert you or the visualization may
indicate indecisiveness by incessant flickering.
NOTE: Practicing a safe disengage before it is
necessary is ideal.
In addition, like Autosteer, Full Self-Driving (Beta)
checks for driver attentiveness and requires your
hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all
times. If your hands are not detected, the instrument
panel displays escalating warnings and failure to
respond to these warnings cancels Full Self-Driving
(Beta) until your next drive.
NOTE: Failure to use Full Self-Driving (Beta)
appropriately may cause the feature to be disabled.
3. Safe disengage: To disengage Full Self-Driving (Beta)
safely, be aware of your surroundings and press the
right scroll wheel, press the brake pedal, or take over
and steer manually.
When arriving at a chosen destination, Full Self-Driving
(Beta) stops Model X and displays a message indicating
that navigation is complete.
NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses Tesla's vision-based
system and therefore radar (if equipped) is disabled.

Tips
• Feedback:
If you experience incorrect or
unexpected behavior, touch the
snapshot icon (if equipped) at the top
of the touchscreen to send data to Tesla
for analysis. Tesla uses this data to
improve the intelligence of Full SelfDriving (Beta).

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Full Self-Driving (Beta)
• Maintain software updates and cameras: Always
remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not
make Model X autonomous. Full autonomy is
dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of
human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of
experience, as well as regulatory approval. As Tesla’s
Full Self-Driving capabilities evolve, Model X is
continuously upgraded through over-the-air software
updates. Download updates as soon as they become
available. To ensure an optimum experience, keep all
cameras clean and unobstructed.

Limitations
Full Self-Driving (Beta) and its associated functions may
not operate as intended and there are numerous
situations in which driver intervention may be needed.
Examples include (but are not limited to):
• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other
road users.
• Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic.
• Multi-lane turns.
• Simultaneous lane changes.
• Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked
vehicles.
• Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open
doors, etc. protruding from vehicles.
• Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads.
• Debris in the road.
• Construction zones.
• High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving
speeds.
WARNING: In addition, visibility is critical for Full
Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such
as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow,
direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade
performance.
WARNING: Model X may quickly and suddenly
make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that
require immediate driver intervention. The list
above represents only a fraction of the possible
scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to
make sudden maneuvers and behave
unexpectedly. In fact, Model X can suddenly
swerve even when driving conditions appear
normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always
pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate
the need to take corrective action as early as
possible. Remember that this is an early access
feature that must be used with extra caution.

Autopilot

133

Autopark
This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until
it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles
manufactured as of approximately January 2023.
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Autopark.
Autopark uses data to simplify parking on public roads
by maneuvering Model X into parallel and perpendicular
parking spaces.
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as
well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot
performance.
WARNING: Autopark's performance depends on
the ability of the cameras and sensors (if
equipped) to determine the vehicle's proximity to
curbs, objects, and other vehicles.
WARNING: Do not use Autopark if anything, such
as a ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to
the tow hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches
when parking between or in front of other vehicles.

Parameters
Autopark detects potential parking spaces based on the
following parameters:
Perpendicular Parking
• Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h). If
driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to
accurately detect your desired parking space.
• The parking space must be at least 7.2 feet (2.2
meters) wide.
• The parking space must have at least three visible
lines for the vehicle to park into, such as parking lines,
road markings, or distinct curbs. Autopark may not
work in a garage, for example, without three visible
parking lines.
• Autopark may not work with textured road surfaces
such as cobblestone or brick.
Parallel Parking
• Your driving speed must be below 13 mph (21 km/h).
If driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to
accurately detect your desired parking space.
• There must be a vehicle in front of the space you
want to park in.
• A distinct curb or edge must be visible. Autopark
may not correctly identify the parking space if the
curb is not distinct, such as grass or dirt.

To Use Autopark
When driving, follow these steps to allow Autopark to
maneuver Model X into a parking space:
1. While driving slowly on a public road, monitor the
instrument panel to determine when Autopark has
detected a parking space. The instrument panel will
display a parking icon if the vehicle detects a
potential parking spot.
NOTE: The parking icon appears only if the vehicle's
position and/or the circumstances of the surrounding
area are such that Autopark can determine an
appropriate driving path. If Autopark cannot
determine an appropriate path (for example, when
driving on a narrow street where moving into the
parking space causes the front of the vehicle to
extend into the adjacent lane), you can either
reposition the vehicle, find a different parking space,
or park manually.
2. Check to determine if the detected parking space is
appropriate and safe. Pull forward and stop
approximately one car length ahead of the parking
space (as you normally would when parallel parking
or when backing into a perpendicular parking space).
3. Release the steering yoke (or steering wheel), then
touch and hold Autopark in the drive mode strip on
the touchscreen. You can release the button once
Autopark engages.
4. Autopark displays a message when parking is
complete.
NOTE: If you press the brake pedal when Autopark is
actively parking Model X, the parking process pauses
until you touch Resume on the touchscreen.
WARNING: Never depend on Autopark to find a
parking space that is legal, suitable, and safe.
Autopark may not always detect objects in the
parking space. Always perform visual checks to
confirm that a parking space is appropriate and
safe.
WARNING: When Autopark is actively steering
Model X, the steering yoke (or steering wheel)
moves in accordance with Autopark's adjustments.
Do not interfere with the movement of the steering
yoke (or steering wheel). Doing so cancels
Autopark.
WARNING: During the parking sequence,
continually check your surroundings. Be prepared
to apply the brakes to avoid vehicles, pedestrians,
or objects.
WARNING: When Autopark is active, monitor the
touchscreen and instrument panel to ensure that
you are aware of the instructions that Autopark is
providing.

NOTE: Autopark does not operate on angled parking
spaces.

134

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Autopark
To Pause Parking
To pause Autopark, press the brake pedal once. Model X
stops and remains stopped until you touch Resume on
the touchscreen.

To Cancel Parking
Autopark cancels the parking sequence when you
manually move the steering yoke (or steering wheel),
shift, or touch Cancel on the touchscreen. Autopark also
cancels parking when:
• The parking sequence exceeds seven moves.
• Model X detects that the driver is exiting the vehicle.
• A door is opened.
• You press the accelerator pedal.
• You press the brake pedal while Autopark is paused.
• An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see
Collision Avoidance Assist on page 145).

Limitations
Autopark is particularly unlikely to operate as intended
in these situations:
• The road is sloped. Autopark is designed to operate
on flat roads only.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• The curb is constructed of material other than stone,
or the curb cannot be detected.
• The target parking space is directly adjacent to a wall
or pillar (for example, the last parking space of a row
in an underground parking structure).
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras
is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice,
or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or
adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber
coating, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering
with sensor (if equipped) operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other
electrical equipment or devices that generate
ultrasonic waves.
WARNING: Many unforeseen circumstances can
impair Autopark's ability to park Model X. Keep
this in mind and remember that as a result,
Autopark may not steer Model X appropriately. Pay
attention when parking Model X and stay prepared
to immediately take control.

Summon
This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until
it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles
manufactured as of approximately January 2023.
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Summon, or the
feature may not operate exactly as described.
Summon allows you to automatically park and retrieve
Model X while you are standing outside the vehicle.
Summon moves Model X forward and reverse up to 39
feet (12 meters) in, or out of, a parking space.
To move Model X a longer distance while steering
around objects, you can use Smart Summon (if
equipped) and your mobile phone. Smart Summon
allows your vehicle to find you (or you can send your
vehicle to a chosen location). See Smart Summon on
page 139.
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as
well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot
performance.
WARNING: Summon is designed and intended for
use only on parking lots and driveways on private
property where the surrounding area is familiar
and predictable.
WARNING: Summon is a BETA feature. You must
continually monitor the vehicle and its
surroundings and stay prepared to take immediate
action at any time. It is the driver's responsibility to
use Summon safely, responsibly, and as intended.
WARNING: Summon's performance depends on
the ability of the cameras and sensors (if
equipped) to determine the vehicle's proximity to
objects, people, animals, and other vehicles.

Before Using Summon
Before operating Summon, use the touchscreen to
enable it and customize how you want it to work. Touch
Controls > Autopilot > Customize Summon and adjust
the following settings to suit your preferences:
• Bumper Clearance: Set the distance that you want
Summon to stop from a detected object (for
example, you may want Summon to stop within just a
few inches of a garage wall). Note that this distance
applies only to objects that Summon detects directly
in front of Model X when moving forward, or directly
behind Model X when reversing.

WARNING: Parking in a narrow space limits the
ability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped)
to accurately detect the location of obstacles,
increasing the risk of damage to Model X
and/or surrounding objects.
• Require Continuous Press: By default, Summon
requires that you press and hold a button on the
mobile app to move Model X during the parking
process. When Require Continuous Press is set to No,
you can press and release the button—you don't need
to hold it down to keep the vehicle moving. Also,
when Require Continuous Press is set to No, you can
operate Summon using the key fob instead of the
mobile app (see Operating Summon with the Key
Fob on page 137) and you can start a parking
sequence from inside the vehicle (see Starting
Summon Before Exiting the Vehicle on page 137).
• Use Auto HomeLink (if equipped): Set to ON if you
want to activate HomeLink to open/close a
programmed HomeLink device (such as a gate or a
garage door) during the parking process when using
Summon. If enabled, the device automatically opens
and closes when Model X enters or exits during a
Summon session. In a Smart Summon session (if
equipped), the device automatically opens when, at
the beginning of a session, Smart Summon detects
that Model X is parked in a garage.
WARNING: Always ensure that Model X is fully
in or out of a garage before HomeLink lowers
the garage door. Summon and Smart Summon
(if equipped) cannot detect where an overhead
door will lower.
NOTE: When enabled, the HomeLink device
automatically opens and closes when using Summon,
and automatically opens as needed when using
Smart Summon (if equipped). To automate HomeLink
in other situations (such as normal driving), you must
adjust the HomeLink device's main settings by
touching the HomeLink icon at the top of the
Controls screen (see Smart Garage on page 70).
NOTE: The above settings, with the exception of
HomeLink, apply only to Summon—not Smart Summon
(if equipped) (see Before Using Smart Summon on page
139). You cannot customize Smart Summon's bumper
clearance, distance, and side clearance. And when using
Smart Summon, you must always hold down the button
on the mobile app to keep Model X moving. Also, Smart
Summon operates with the mobile app only—not the key
fob.
NOTE: All settings are retained until you manually
change them.

• Summon Distance: Set a maximum distance that
Model X can travel when entering or exiting a parking
space.

Using Summon to Park and Retrieve
your Vehicle

• Side Clearance: Choose an option to specify how
much side clearance you want to allow. Tight allows
Model X to enter and exit very narrow parking
spaces.

Follow these steps to use Summon to park your
Model X:

136

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Summon
• Align Model X within 39 feet (12 meters) of the
parking space so Model X can follow a straight path
into or out of the space in either Drive or Reverse.
• From outside the vehicle, initiate the parking
maneuver by touching Summon on the mobile app,
then holding down the Forward or Reverse button.
NOTE: If the Require Continuous Press setting is No,
you do not need to hold down the button, just press
and release.
NOTE: You can also initiate the parking maneuver
from inside the vehicle (see Starting Summon Before
Exiting the Vehicle on page 137).
Summon shifts Model X into Drive or Reverse (based on
the direction you specified) and drives into or out of the
parking space. When parking is complete, or if an
obstacle is detected, Summon shifts Model X into Park.
Summon shifts Model X into Park when:
• Model X detects an obstacle in its driving path
(within the Bumper Clearance setting that you
specified).
• Summon has moved Model X the maximum distance
of 39 feet (12 meters).
• You release the Forward or Reverse button (when
Require Continuous Press is turned on).
• You press any button to manually stop Summon.
If you used Summon to park Model X, you can then use
Summon to return Model X back to its original position
(provided Model X has remained in Park), or to the
maximum Summon Distance that you have specified
(whichever comes first). Simply specify the opposite
direction on the mobile app and Summon moves
Model X along the original path, provided no
obstructions have been introduced. If an obstacle is
detected, Model X attempts to avoid the obstacle while
staying very close to its original path (Summon does not
steer around obstacles).
NOTE: To use Summon to move Model X multiple times
in the same direction (not to exceed the maximum of 39
feet (12 meters), cancel Summon and then restart the
parking process using the same direction.
NOTE: Although Summon can move Model X a short
distance laterally to avoid an obstacle, it does not
attempt to steer around an obstacle to return Model X
to its original driving path. Only Smart Summon (if
equipped) can steer Model X around objects.
NOTE: Summon requires that Model X can detect a valid
key nearby.

WARNING: Model X cannot detect obstacles that
are located lower than the bumper, are very
narrow, or are hanging from a ceiling (for example,
bicycles). In addition, many unforeseen
circumstances can impair Summon's ability to
move in or out of a parking space and, as a result,
Summon may not move Model X appropriately.
Therefore, you must continually monitor the
vehicle's movement and its surroundings and
remain prepared to stop Model X at any time.

Operating Summon with the Key Fob
NOTE: Summon may not operate if the battery is low on
the key fob.
Follow these steps to park Model X from outside the
vehicle using the key fob:
1. On the touchscreen, ensure that Require Continuous

Customize Summon > Require Continuous Press).
2. With Model X in Park, stand within 10 feet (three
meters) and press and hold the top center button on
the key fob (Lock/Unlock All button) until the hazard
lights blink continuously.
NOTE: The hazard lights flash once as Model X locks,
then within five seconds, Model X powers on and the
hazard lights flash continuously. Do not proceed to
the next step until the hazard lights are flashing. If,
after five seconds, the hazard lights are not flashing,
release the button on the key fob, move closer to
Model X, and try again. If Summon receives no further
input within ten seconds, Summon cancels.
3. Press the Front Trunk button on the key fob to move
Model X forward into the parking space, or press the
Rear Trunk button to reverse Model X into the
parking space.

of approximately 39 feet (12 meters).
• Your phone enters sleep mode or loses connectivity
to Model X.

Limitations
Summon is unlikely to operate as intended in the
following types of situations:
• The driving path is sloped. Summon is designed to
operate on flat roads only (up to 10% grade).
• A raised concrete edge is detected. Summon does
not move Model X over an edge that is higher than
approximately 1 in (2.5 cm).
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras
is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice,
or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or
adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber
coating, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering
with sensor operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other
electrical equipment or devices that generate
ultrasonic waves.
• Model X is in Trailer Mode or an accessory is
attached.
NOTE: Summon is disabled if Model X is in Valet mode
(see Valet Mode on page 97).

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Smart Summon
This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until
it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles
manufactured as of approximately January 2023.
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Smart Summon,
or the feature may not operate exactly as described.
Smart Summon is designed to allow you to move
Model X to your location (using your phone's GPS as a
target destination) or to a location of your choice,
maneuvering around and stopping for objects as
necessary. Smart Summon works with the Tesla mobile
app when your phone is located within approximately
213 feet (65 meters) of Model X. Smart Summon
maneuvers Model X out of parking spaces and around
corners. This is useful for moving Model X out of a tight
parking spot, through puddles, or helping you retrieve
your car while carrying packages. You must maintain a
clear line of sight between you and Model X and closely
monitor the vehicle and its surroundings at all times.
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as
well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot
performance.
WARNING: Smart Summon is designed and
intended for use only on parking lots and
driveways located on private property where the
surrounding area is familiar and predictable. Do
not use Smart Summon on public roads.
WARNING: Smart Summon must only be used on
paved surfaces.
WARNING: Smart Summon is a BETA feature. You
must continually monitor the vehicle and its
surroundings and stay prepared to take immediate
action at any time. It is the driver's responsibility to
use Smart Summon safely, responsibly, and as
intended.
WARNING: Smart Summon may not stop for all
objects (especially very low objects such as some
curbs, or very high objects such as a shelf) and
may not react to all traffic. Smart Summon does
not recognize the direction of traffic, does not
navigate around empty parking spaces, and may
not anticipate crossing traffic.
WARNING: Smart Summon's performance
depends on the sensors (if equipped), the visibility
of the cameras, and the availability of an adequate
cellular signal and GPS data.
WARNING: When using Smart Summon, you must
maintain a clear line of sight between you and
Model X and stay prepared to stop the vehicle at
any time by releasing the button on the mobile
app.

Autopilot

Before Using Smart Summon
• Download the latest version of the Tesla mobile app
to your phone, and ensure your phone has cellular
service and GPS enabled.
• Your phone must be connected to Model X and
located within approximately 213 feet (65 meters).
• The vehicle's cameras must be fully calibrated (see
Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 111).
• You must have a clear line of sight to Model X.
• Model X must be in Park, not charging, and all doors
and trunks must be closed.

Using Smart Summon
1. Open the Tesla mobile app, and press Summon.
2. Press the Smart Summon icon located in the center
of the image of your Model X. It may take several
seconds for Smart Summon to start up.
NOTE: You can use Standby Mode to eliminate the

(see Standby Mode on page 140).
The mobile app displays a map with a blue circle,
which represents the maximum proximity of 213 feet
(65 meters) that you must maintain between your
phone and Model X. The blue dot on the map
represents your location, and the red arrow
represents the vehicle.
3. Position yourself anywhere within the blue circle
where you have a clear line of sight to Model X.
4. You can now operate Smart Summon using either of
these modes:
◦ Come to Me mode: Press and hold the Come to
Me button. Model X moves to your GPS location.
As you move, Model X follows you. When Model X
reaches you, it stops and shifts into park.
◦ Go to Target mode: Touch the crosshair icon then
drag the map to position the pin on a chosen
destination. Press and hold the Go to Target
button. Model X moves to the destination. When
reaching the location, Model X stops and shifts
into Park and the mobile app displays a message
indicating that Summon has completed.
NOTE: To subsequently change the location, lift
your finger, reposition the map, then press and
hold Go to Target again.
To stop Model X at any time, simply release the Come
to Me or Go to Target button.
The map's crosshair icon toggles between
Go to Target and Come to Me modes.
When Come to Me mode is selected, the
icon is blue.

139

Smart Summon
NOTE: The map also has an icon that
allows you to display/hide satellite imagery.
Immediately after initiating Smart Summon in either
mode, hazard lights briefly flash, mirrors fold, and
Model X shifts into Drive or Reverse. Model X then slowly
moves to within 3 feet (1 meter) of you (Come to Me) or
your chosen destination (Go to Target), navigating
obstacles as needed. As Model X moves, the
corresponding red arrow on the map also moves to
show the vehicle’s location. As you move, the
corresponding blue dot also moves to show your
location.
In either mode, Model X stops moving and shifts into
park when:
• You release the button on the mobile app.
• The maximum proximity between your phone and
Model X is exceeded (if moving the vehicle to a
destination away from you, you may need to follow
the car to maintain this distance).
• The driving path is blocked.
• Model X has moved the maximum distance of 475
feet (145 meters) since the start of the Smart
Summon session, or has moved 492 feet (150 meters)
away from the location from which the vehicle was
last driven manually.
NOTE: If Smart Summon moves Model X forward
three feet and then backwards two feet, this is
considered five feet of travel.
NOTE: There is no need to look at the mobile app—just
hold down the button while keeping your eye on
Model X and its driving path at all times, remaining
ready to release the button to stop the vehicle if needed.
If equipped and Auto HomeLink is enabled for Summon
(touch Controls > Autopilot > Customize Summon > Use
Auto HomeLink), Smart Summon automatically opens a
HomeLink device if you start the Smart Summon
maneuver when Model X is located inside a garage. The
mobile app informs you that the door has opened.
WARNING: When you release the button to stop
Model X, a slight delay occurs before the vehicle
stops. Therefore, it is critical that you pay close
attention to the vehicle’s driving path at all times
and proactively anticipate obstacles that the
vehicle may be unable to detect.
WARNING: Use extreme caution when using Smart
Summon in environments where movement of
obstacles can be unpredictable. For example,
where people, children or animals are present.
WARNING: Smart Summon may not stop for all
objects (especially very low objects such as some
curbs, or very high objects such as a shelf) and
may not react to all oncoming or side traffic. Pay
attention and be ready to stop Model X at all times
by releasing the button on the mobile app.
140

Standby Mode
To keep Model X ready to Summon and reduce the time
it takes to warm up, turn on Standby Mode. Touch
Controls > Autopilot > Standby Mode. When Standby
Mode is turned on, you can conserve Battery energy by
disabling Standby Mode at these locations:
• Exclude Home - Disables Standby Mode at the
location you set as Home in your Favorites list.
• Exclude Work - Disables Standby Mode at the
location you set as Work in your Favorites list.
• Exclude Favorites - Disables Standby Mode at any
location in your Favorites list.
NOTE: To conserve energy, Smart Summon
automatically exits Standby mode from midnight to
6:00 am. During these hours, a delay occurs as Smart
Summon starts up.
NOTE: Additional battery power may be consumed
while Standby Mode is active.
NOTE: For details on how to designate a location as
Home, Work, or Favorites, see Home, Work, and Favorite

Summon session, simply press the Come to Me or Go to
Target button again.
WARNING: Always anticipate when you need to
stop Model X. Depending on the quality of the
connectivity between the phone and Model X,
there may be a slight delay between when you
release the button and when the car stops.
Smart Summon cancels, and requires you to restart it,
when:
• You press any button on the key fob.
• A door handle is engaged or a door is opened.
• You interact with the steering yoke (or steering
wheel), brake pedal, accelerator pedal, or shift.
• Model X is blocked by an obstacle.
• Smart Summon has moved Model X the maximum
distance. To move further than this distance, you
must shift Model X into Drive or Reverse and then reinitiate a Smart Summon session.
• Your phone enters sleep mode or loses connectivity
to Model X.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Smart Summon
Limitations
Smart Summon is unlikely to operate as intended in the
following types of situations:
• GPS data is unavailable due to poor cellular coverage.
• The driving path is sloped. Smart Summon is
designed to operate on flat roads only (up to 10%
grade).
• A raised concrete edge is detected. Depending on
the height of the concrete edge, Smart Summon may
not move Model X over it.
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras
is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice,
or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or
adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber
coating, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering
with sensor (if equipped) or camera operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other
electrical equipment or devices that generate
ultrasonic waves.
• Model X is in Trailer Mode or an accessory is
attached.
NOTE: Smart Summon is disabled if Model X is in Valet
mode (see Valet Mode on page 97).
WARNING: The list above does not represent an
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with
proper operation of Smart Summon. It is the
driver's responsibility to remain in control of
Model X at all times. Pay close attention whenever
Smart Summon is actively moving Model X and
stay prepared to take immediate action. Failure to
do so can result in serious property damage, injury
or death.

Autopilot

141

Lane Assist
Model X monitors the markers on the lane you are
driving in as well as the surrounding areas for the
presence of vehicles or other objects.
When an object is detected in your blind spot or near
the side of Model X (such as a vehicle, guard rail, etc.),
the instrument panel displays colored lines radiating
from the image of your vehicle. The location of the lines
correspond to the location of the detected object. The
color of the lines (white, yellow, orange, or red)
represent the object's proximity to Model X, with white
being the farthest and red being the closest and
requiring your immediate attention. These colored lines
only display when driving between approximately 7 and
85 mph (12 and 140 km/h). When Autosteer is active,
these colored lines also display if driving slower than 7
mph (12 km/h). However, the colored lines do not display
if Model X is at a standstill (for example, in heavy traffic).

Steering Interventions
Lane Assist provides steering interventions if Model X
drifts into (or close to) an adjacent lane in which an
object, such as a vehicle, is detected. In these situations,
Model X automatically steers to a safer position in the
driving lane. This steering is applied only when Model X
is traveling between 30 and 85 mph (48 and 140 km/h)
on major roads with clearly visible lane markings. When
a steering intervention is applied, the instrument panel
briefly displays a warning message.

Lane Departure Avoidance
Lane Departure Avoidance is designed to warn you if
Model X is drifting out of, or nears the edge of, your
driving lane.
Lane Departure Avoidance operates when driving
between 40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on roads
with clearly visible lane markings. You can choose if and
how you want Lane Departure Warning to operate by
touching Controls > Autopilot > Lane Departure
Avoidance and selecting between these options:
• Off: You are not warned of lane departures or
potential collisions with a vehicle in an adjacent lane.
• Warning: If a front wheel passes over a lane marking,
the steering yoke (or steering wheel) vibrates.

CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as
well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot
performance.
WARNING: Lane Assist features are for guidance
purposes only and is not intended to replace your
own direct visual checks. Before changing lanes,
always use side mirrors and perform the
appropriate shoulder checks to visually determine
if it is safe and appropriate to change lanes.
WARNING: Never depend on Lane Assist to inform
you if you unintentionally drive outside of the
driving lane, or to inform you that there is a vehicle
beside you or in your blind spot. Several external
factors can reduce the performance of Lane Assist
(see Limitations and Inaccuracies on page 143). It
is the driver's responsibility to stay alert and pay
attention to the driving lane and other road users.
Failure to do so can result in serious injury or
death.

• Assist: Corrective steering is applied to keep Model X
in a safe position if Model X drifts into an adjacent
lane or near the edge of the road.
When Lane Departure Avoidance is enabled and TrafficAware Cruise Control is active, if Model X drifts out of
the driving lane when the associated turn signal is off,
Lane Assist also checks to see whether your hands are
on the steering yoke (or steering wheel). If hands are not
detected, the instrument panel displays a series of alerts,
similar to those that are used when driving with
Autosteer. If hands are repeatedly not detected Model X
gradually slows down to 15 mph (25 km/h) below the
detected speed limit, or below the set cruising speed,
and the hazard lights start flashing.
NOTE: Lane Departure Avoidance does not warn you of
lane departures, or provide steering interventions, if the
associated turn signal is on, which indicates an
intentional lane change.
WARNING: Lane Departure Avoidance is intended
to help keep you safe, but it does not work in
every situation and does not replace the need to
remain attentive and in control.
WARNING: Keep your hands on the steering yoke
(or steering wheel) and drive attentively at all
times.
WARNING: Steering interventions are minimal and
are not designed to move Model X out of its
driving lane. Do not rely on steering interventions
to avoid side collisions.

situations where:
• Model X is departing a lane and may collide with a
vehicle traveling in the same direction in the adjacent
lane (regardless of the status of the turn signal).
• Model X is departing a lane into an oncoming lane,
the turn signal is off, and an oncoming vehicle is
detected.

Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime
If you want a chime to sound when a vehicle is in your
blind spot and a possible collision is detected, touch
Controls > Autopilot > Blind Spot Collision Warning
Chime.
WARNING: Blind Spot Camera does not eliminate
the need to drive attentively and manually perform
shoulder checks when changing lanes.

red.
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance operates when
Model X is traveling between 40 and 90 mph (64 and
145 km/h) on a road with clearly visible lane markings,
curbs, etc.
WARNING: Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance
is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound
judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when
driving and never depend on Emergency Lane
Departure Avoidance to prevent a collision. Several
factors can reduce or impair performance.
Depending on Emergency Lane Departure
Avoidance to prevent a potential collision can
result in serious injury or death.

Automatic Blind Spot Camera
To display the image from the corresponding side
repeater camera whenever you engage a turn signal to
change lanes, touch Controls > Autopilot > Automatic
Blind Spot Camera.
When the turn signal is engaged and the touchscreen is
displaying the image from the side repeater camera, you
can move the image to a different location on the
touchscreen. To do so, touch and drag the image to the
new location (valid locations are indicated by shaded
areas that display when you touch and hold the image).
WARNING: Automatic Blind Spot Camera does not
eliminate the need to drive attentively and
manually perform shoulder checks when changing
lanes.

shadows on lane markers.
Lane Assist may not provide warnings, or may apply
inappropriate warnings, in these situations:
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras
is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (by mud, ice, or
snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive
products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coatings,
etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering
with sensor operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other
electrical equipment or devices that generate
ultrasonic waves.
• An object that is mounted to Model X is interfering
with and/or obstructing a sensor (such as a bike rack
or a bumper sticker).

143

Lane Assist
In addition, Lane Assist may not steer Model X away
from an adjacent vehicle, or may apply unnecessary or
inappropriate steering, in these situations:
• You are driving Model X on sharp corners or on a
curve at a relatively high speed.
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or
direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the
camera(s).
• You are drifting into another lane but an object (such
as a vehicle) is not present.
• A vehicle in another lane cuts in front of you or drifts
into your driving lane.
• Model X is not traveling within the speeds at which
the Lane Assist feature is designed to operate.
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) is damaged,
dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or
by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive
products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating,
etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Collision Avoidance Assist
The following collision avoidance features are designed
to increase the safety of you and your passengers:
• Forward Collision Warning - provides visual, audible,
and haptic feedback warnings in situations when
Model X detects that there is a high risk of a frontal
collision (see Forward Collision Warning on page
145).
• Automatic Emergency Braking - automatically
applies braking to reduce the impact of a collision
(see Automatic Emergency Braking on page 146).
• Obstacle-Aware Acceleration - reduces acceleration
if Model X detects an object in its immediate driving
path (see Obstacle-Aware Acceleration on page 146).
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as
well as environmental conditions such as rain and
faded lane markings, can affect performance.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is for
guidance purposes only and is not a substitute for
attentive driving and sound judgment. Keep your
eyes on the road when driving and never depend
on Forward Collision Warning to warn you of a
potential collision. Several factors can reduce or
impair performance, causing either unnecessary,
invalid, inaccurate, or missed warnings. Depending
on Forward Collision Warning to warn you of a
potential collision can result in serious injury or
death.
WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is not
designed to prevent all collisions. In certain
situations, it can minimize the impact of a collision
by attempting to reduce your driving speed.
Depending on Automatic Emergency Braking to
avoid a collision can result in serious injury or
death.
WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is not
designed to prevent a collision. In certain
situations, it can minimize the impact of a collision.
Depending on Obstacle-Aware Acceleration to
avoid a collision can result in serious injury or
death.

Forward Collision Warning
Model X monitors the area in front of it for the presence
of an object such as a vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, or
pedestrian. If a collision is considered likely unless you
take immediate corrective action, Forward Collision
Warning is designed to sound a chime and highlight the
vehicle in front of you in red on the instrument panel. If
this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION!

Active Safety Features

Visual, audible, and haptic feedback warnings cancel
automatically when the risk of a collision has been
reduced (for example, you have decelerated or stopped
Model X, or the object in front of your vehicle has moved
out of your driving path).
If immediate action is not taken when Model X issues a
Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency
Braking (if enabled) may automatically apply the brakes
if a collision is considered imminent (see Automatic
Emergency Braking on page 146).
By default, Forward Collision Warning is turned on. To
turn it off or adjust its sensitivity, touch Controls >
Autopilot > Forward Collision Warning. Instead of the
default warning level of Medium, you can turn the
warning Off, or you can choose to be warned Late or
Early.
NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually
change it.
WARNING: The camera(s) and sensors (if
equipped) associated with Forward Collision
Warning are designed to monitor an approximate
area of up to 525 feet (160 meters) in your driving
path. The area being monitored by Forward
Collision Warning can be adversely affected by
road and weather conditions. Use appropriate
caution when driving.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is designed
only to provide visual and audible alerts. It does
not attempt to apply the brakes or decelerate
Model X. When seeing and/or hearing a warning, it
is the driver's responsibility to take immediate
corrective action.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning may
provide a warning in situations where the
likelihood of collision may not exist. Stay alert and
always pay attention to the area in front of
Model X so you can anticipate whether any action
is required.

145

Collision Avoidance Assist
Forward Collision Warning operates only when driving
between approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and 124 mph
(200 km/h).
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning does not
provide a warning when the driver is already
applying the brake.

Automatic Emergency Braking
Model X is designed to determine the distance from
detected objects. When a collision is considered
unavoidable, Automatic Emergency Braking is designed
to apply the brakes to reduce the vehicle's speed and
therefore, the severity of the impact. The amount of
speed that is reduced depends on many factors,
including driving speed and environment.
When Automatic Emergency Braking applies the brakes,
the instrument panel displays a visual warning and
sounds a chime. You may also notice abrupt downward
movement of the brake pedal. The brake lights turn on
to alert other road users that you are slowing down.
Emergency braking in progress

Automatic Emergency Braking operates only when
driving between approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and 124
mph (200 km/h).
Automatic Emergency Braking does not apply the
brakes, or stops applying the brakes, when:
• You turn the steering yoke (or steering wheel)
sharply.

WARNING: It is strongly recommended that you
do not disable Automatic Emergency Braking. If
you disable it, Model X does not automatically
apply the brakes in situations where a collision is
considered likely.
WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is
designed to reduce the severity of an impact. It is
not designed to avoid a collision.
WARNING: Several factors can affect the
performance of Automatic Emergency Braking,
causing either no braking or inappropriate or
untimely braking, such as when a vehicle is
partially in the path of travel or there is road
debris. It is the driver’s responsibility to drive
safely and remain in control of the vehicle at all
times. Never depend on Automatic Emergency
Braking to avoid or reduce the impact of a
collision.
WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is not a
substitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance
between you and the vehicle in front of you.
WARNING: The brake pedal moves downward
abruptly during automatic braking events. Always
ensure that the brake pedal can move freely. Do
not place material under or on top of the driver’s
floor mat (including an additional mat) and always
ensure that the driver’s floor mat is properly
secured. Failure to do so can impede the ability of
the brake pedal to move freely.

Multi-Collision Braking
In addition to Automatic Emergency Braking, Model X
may apply the brakes to prevent or mitigate a
subsequent impact after an initial collision if airbag
deployment is detected. The brakes may be applied
regardless of driving speed.

• You press and release the brake pedal while
Automatic Emergency Braking is applying the brakes.

Obstacle-Aware Acceleration

• You accelerate hard while Automatic Emergency
Braking is applying the brakes.

Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to reduce the
impact of a collision by reducing motor torque and in
some cases applying the brakes, if Model X detects an
object in its driving path. The instrument panel displays
a visual warning and sounds a chime when the brakes
are automatically applied. For example, Model X, while
parked in front of a closed garage door with Drive
engaged, detects that you have pressed hard on the
accelerator pedal. Although Model X still accelerates and
hits the garage door, the reduced torque may result in
less damage.

• The vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian is no
longer detected ahead.
Automatic Emergency Braking is always enabled when
you start Model X. To disable it for your current drive,
touch Controls > Autopilot > Automatic Emergency
Braking. Even if you disable Automatic Emergency
Braking, your vehicle may still apply the brakes after
detecting an initial collision to reduce further impact
(see Multi-Collision Braking on page 146).
NOTE: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to
reduce the impact of frontal and reverse collisions with
limited functionality while in Reverse.

Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to operate
only when all of these conditions are simultaneously
met:
• Drive or Reverse is engaged.
• Model X is stopped or traveling less than 10 mph (16
km/h).

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Collision Avoidance Assist
• Model X detects an object in its immediate driving
path.
To disable Obstacle-Aware Acceleration, touch Controls
> Autopilot > Obstacle-Aware Acceleration.
WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is
designed to reduce the severity of an impact. It is
not designed to avoid a collision.
WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration may not
limit torque in all situations. Several factors,
including environmental conditions, distance from
an obstacle, and a driver's actions, can limit, delay,
or inhibit Obstacle-Aware Acceleration.

WARNING: The limitations previously described do
not represent an exhaustive list of situations that
may interfere with proper operation of Collision
Avoidance Assist features. These features may fail
to provide their intended function for many other
reasons. It is the driver’s responsibility to avoid
collisions by staying alert, paying attention, and
taking corrective action as early as possible.
CAUTION: If a fault occurs with a Collision
Avoidance Assist feature, Model X displays an
alert. Contact Tesla Service.

WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration may not
limit torque when performing a sharp turn, such as
into a parking space.
WARNING: Do not rely on Obstacle-Aware
Acceleration to control acceleration or to avoid, or
limit, the severity of a collision, and do not attempt
to test Obstacle-Aware Acceleration. Doing so can
result in serious property damage, injury, or death.
WARNING: Several factors can affect the
performance of Obstacle-Aware Acceleration,
causing an inappropriate or untimely reduction in
motor torque and/or undesired braking. It is the
driver's responsibility to drive safely and remain in
control of Model X at all times.

Limitations and Inaccuracies
Collision Avoidance features cannot always detect all
objects, vehicles, bikes, or pedestrians, and you may
experience unnecessary, inaccurate, invalid, or missed
warnings for many reasons, particularly if:
• The road has sharp curves.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or
direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the
camera(s).
• A camera or sensor is obstructed (dirty, covered,
fogged over, covered by a sticker, etc.).
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) is damaged,
dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or
by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive
products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating,
etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering
with sensor operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other
electrical equipment or devices that generate
ultrasonic waves.

Speed Assist
How Speed Assist Works

Limitations and Inaccuracies

Model X displays a speed limit on the instrument panel
and you can choose if and how you are warned when
you exceed the speed limit. Also, instead of using the
detected speed limit, you can base warnings on an
arbitrary speed limit that you enter manually.

Speed Assist may not be fully functional or may provide
inaccurate information in these situations:

In situations where Model X is unable to determine a
speed limit, or if Speed Assist is uncertain that an
acquired speed limit is accurate, the instrument panel
may not display a speed limit sign and warnings do not
take effect.

• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or
direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the
camera(s).

NOTE: Speed limit warnings go away after ten seconds,
or when Model X slows down below the specified limit.
WARNING: Do not rely on Speed Assist to
determine the appropriate speed limit or driving
speed. Always drive at a safe speed based on
traffic and road conditions.

Controlling Speed Assist
To adjust the Speed Limit Warning setting, touch
Controls > Autopilot > Speed Limit Warning, then
choose one of these options:
• Off - Speed limit warnings do not display and chimes
are not sounded.
• Display - Speed limit signs display on the instrument
panel and the sign increases in size when you exceed
the determined limit.
• Chime - In addition to the visual display, a chime is
sounded when you exceed the determined speed
limit.

• Visibility is poor and speed limit signs are not clearly
visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).

• Model X is being driven very close to a vehicle in
front of it which is blocking the view of the
camera(s).
• The windshield is obstructing the view of the
camera(s) (fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker,
etc.).
• Speed limit signs are concealed by objects.
• The speed limits stored in the map database are
incorrect or outdated.
• Model X is being driven in an area where GPS or map
data is not available or where speed limit signs can
not be detected.
• Traffic signs that do not conform to standard
recognizable formats, such as digital or temporary
speed signs.
• A road or a speed limit has recently changed.
WARNING: The list above does not represent an
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with
proper operation of Speed Assist. Speed Assist
may fail to provide warnings for many other
reasons.

You can also specify how the speed limit is determined:
• Relative - You can set a speed limit offset (+ or -) if
you want to be alerted only when you exceed the
offset speed limit by a specified amount. For
example, you can increase the offset to +10 mph (10
km/h) if you only want to be warned when you
exceed the speed limit by 10 mph (10 km/h).
NOTE: The offset from speed limit also affects the
number shown in the gray speed icon on the
instrument panel.
• Absolute - Manually specify any speed limit between
20 and 140 mph (30 and 240 km/h).
NOTE: Speed Assist is not always accurate. In some
situations, the location of a road can be miscalculated
and Speed Assist can display a speed for a directly
adjacent road that may have a different speed limit. For
example, Speed Assist can assume Model X is on a
controlled-access highway when it is actually on a
nearby surface street, and vice versa.
NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually
change it.
148

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Cabin Camera
Your Model X is equipped with a cabin camera located
above the rear view mirror.

NOTE: Keep the camera lens clean and free of
obstructions. Remove any buildup of dirt or dust by
occasionally wiping the camera lens with a clean cloth.
CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive
cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the
camera lens.

The cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness
and provide you with audible alerts, to remind you to
keep your eyes on the road when Autopilot is engaged.
By default, images and video from the camera do not
leave the vehicle itself and are not transmitted to
anyone, including Tesla, unless you enable data sharing.
If you enable data sharing and a safety critical event
occurs (such as a collision), Model X shares short cabin
camera video clips with Tesla to help us develop future
safety enhancements and continuously improve the
intelligence of features that rely on the cabin camera.
Data may also be shared if diagnostics are required on
cabin camera functionality. Cabin camera does not
perform facial recognition or any other method of
identity verification. To protect your privacy, cabin
camera data is not associated with your vehicle
identification number.
To adjust your data sharing preferences touch Controls >
Software > Data Sharing > Allow Cabin Camera
Analytics. You can change your data sharing settings at
any time.

Controls > Safety > Tilt/Intrusion.
The intrusion sensor automatically disables in situations
where the climate control system is operating when you
leave your vehicle. To override, you can manually turn
the Tilt/Intrusion Sensor on again after choosing Keep
Climate On, Dog, or Camp Mode.
The tilt/intrusion sensor automatically re-enables at the
start of every drive cycle.
NOTE: If you plan to leave something that moves inside
your locked vehicle, remember to turn off Tilt/Intrusion.
If this setting is on, any motion detected inside Model X
activates the intrusion alarm.

Enhanced Anti-Theft Upgrade (if
equipped)
If your vehicle is equipped with the Enhanced Anti-Theft
upgrade, the horn sounds in situations where a locked
door or trunk is opened and Model X does not detect a
key nearby. If Tilt/Intrusion is on, the horn also sounds if
Model X detects motion inside the cabin or if the vehicle

Dashcam, Sentry, and Security

151

Dashcam
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Dashcam or the
features may not operate exactly as described. It is your
sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local
regulations and property restrictions regarding the use
of cameras.
Dashcam records video footage of your vehicle's
surroundings when driving Model X. Use Dashcam to
record driving incidents or other notable events, like you
would for an external dashcam on other vehicles.
The Dashcam icon is located in the app launcher. You
can add the Dashcam app to the bottom bar for easy
access (see Customizing My Apps on page 11). When
Model X is in Park, touching the Dashcam icon displays
the Viewer (see Viewing Video Recordings on page 155).

To protect your privacy, video recordings are saved
locally to a formatted USB flash drive's onboard
memory. Recordings are not sent to Tesla. Model X does
not record videos when Dashcam is Off.

How to Use Dashcam
1. Format a USB flash drive. Dashcam requires a
properly formatted USB drive inserted in your
vehicle's USB port (Tesla recommends using the
glovebox USB port, if equipped) to store and retrieve
footage. Vehicles manufactured beginning
approximately 2020 are equipped with a preformatted USB flash drive in the glove box. There are
two ways to format the flash drive:
◦ Insert the flash drive into the USB port and
navigate to Controls > Safety > Format USB Drive.
Model X automatically formats the flash drive for
you.
◦ Format the flash drive on a computer.
See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos on
page 155 for more information.
2. Insert the USB flash drive into your vehicle's USB
port.
3. Enable Dashcam by touching Controls > Safety >
Dashcam. Dashcam allows you to choose how and
when footage is saved. You can choose between:
◦ Auto: Dashcam automatically saves a recording to
the USB drive when Model X detects a safetycritical event, such as a collision or airbag
deployment. When Auto is selected, detection can
vary and is subject to your vehicle's power, sleep,
and Autopilot state.

152

NOTE: Several factors determine whether
Dashcam automatically saves a recording of a
safety-critical event (for example, amount of force,
whether or not airbags deploy, etc.). Do not rely
on Dashcam to automatically record all safetycritical events.
◦ Manual: You must manually touch the Dashcam
icon to save a recording of the most recent ten
minutes of footage.
◦ On Honk: When you press the horn, Dashcam
saves a recording of the most recent ten minutes
of footage. You can enable this along with Auto or
Manual.
4. Once enabled, the Dashcam icon indicates when
footage is saved. You can also view the status of the
Dashcam icon in Controls:

The icon changes to show the status of Dashcam:
RECORDING: Dashcam is recording. To
save video footage, touch the icon. To
pause recording, press and hold the
icon.
PAUSED: Dashcam is paused. To resume
recording, touch the icon. To avoid
losing video footage, pause Dashcam
before removing the flash drive.
SAVED: Footage is saved. You can also
save Dashcam clips by touching the
Dashcam icon in the app launcher while
Driving.
NOTE: Once saved, Dashcam saves the last 10
minutes of footage.
5. Once your desired footage is saved, view the clips on
the touchscreen or a computer:

the Dashcam icon in the app launcher. Videos are
organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video
Recordings on page 155 for more information.
◦ Computer: Insert the USB flash drive into a
computer and navigate to the TeslaCam folder.
Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing
Video Recordings on page 155 for more
information.
6. To turn Dashcam off, navigate to Controls > Safety >
Dashcam > Off. If set to Auto, Manual, or On Honk,
Dashcam automatically enables every time you drive.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Sentry Mode
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle
configuration, options purchased, and software version,
your vehicle may not be equipped with Sentry Mode or
the features may not operate exactly as described. It is
your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all
local regulations and property restrictions regarding the
use of cameras.
When enabled, your vehicle's cameras and sensors (if
equipped) remain powered on and ready to record
suspicious activity around your vehicle when Model X is
locked and in Park. Think of Sentry Mode as an
intelligent vehicle security system that alerts you when it
detects possible threats nearby.
If a threat is detected, Sentry Mode pulses the
headlights, sounds the alarm, and displays a message on
the touchscreen indicating that the cameras may be
recording to inform individuals outside of the vehicle.
You will receive an alert on your phone through the
mobile app and footage of the event is saved to USB
drive (if installed).
Sentry Mode is disabled by default. You can use voice
commands or the Tesla mobile app to easily enable or
disable Sentry Mode. To enable Sentry Mode using voice
commands, say "Keep Tesla safe," "Keep my car safe,"
"Sentry on," or "Enable Sentry" (see Voice Commands
on page 20).
Sentry Mode requires your Battery to be at least 20%
charged. If the Battery falls below 20%, Sentry Mode
turns off and the mobile app sends you a notification.
Power consumption may increase when Sentry Mode is
active.
NOTE: Software updates cannot be installed when
Sentry Mode is turned on.
CAUTION: Do not rely on Sentry Mode to protect
Model X from all possible security threats. Sentry
Mode uses many factors to determine whether to
activate the security alarm. All impacts may not be
detected and the alarm may not activate in all
situations. While it may help deter some threats,
no security system can prevent all attacks.

How to Use Sentry Mode (Camera +
App)
1. Sentry Mode requires a properly formatted USB drive
inserted in your vehicle's USB port (Tesla
recommends using the glovebox USB port, if
equipped) to store and retrieve footage. Vehicles
manufactured from approximately 2020 are
equipped with a pre-formatted USB drive in the glove
box. There are two ways to format the USB drive:
◦ Insert the USB drive into the USB port and
navigate to Controls > Safety > Format USB Drive.
Your vehicle automatically formats the USB drive
for you.

See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos on
page 155 for more information.
2. Insert the USB drive into the vehicle's USB port.
3. With your vehicle in Park, enable Dashcam by
navigating to Controls > Safety > Dashcam.
4. Touch Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode > On. Once
enabled, the Sentry Mode icon in the Controls tab
turns red.

When enabled, Sentry Mode is idle, ready to sound
the alarm and save a recording of the security event
if triggered. See Viewing Video Recordings on page
155 for information on viewing footage.
5. To silence the security alarm and audio system when
the alarm is triggered, navigate to Controls > Safety >
Disable Sentry Sounds. When enabled, Sentry Mode
still sends a notification through the mobile app and
saves the last 10 minutes footage.
6. To manually enable/disable Sentry Mode until the
next drive, touch the Sentry Mode icon in Controls.
Sentry Mode is Off when the icon is no longer red.

Turn Sentry Mode Off in Controls > Safety > Sentry
Mode to disable for more than one drive cycle.

How to Use Sentry Mode (App
Only)
When Sentry mode is enabled and a security event is
detected but without a USB drive plugged into a USB
port, your vehicle alerts you through the mobile app,
without any camera recordings.

Sentry Mode Settings
• Exclude specific locations
In Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode, you can
determine if you want Sentry Mode to not enable in
certain locations (see Home, Work, and Favorite

to vehicle sensors to detect a security event while
parked. If disabled, your vehicle only saves clips to
the USB drive if a physical threat is detected. To
adjust, touch Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode >
Camera-Based Detection.

You can also enable Dog Mode at the same time and
switch the live camera view to see through the
interior camera on the mobile app. See Keep Climate
On, Dog, and Camp on page 158 for more
information. This feature is not supported in vehicles
with Autopilot computer 2.0 or 2.5. Touch Controls >
Service > Autopilot computer to find out which
computer your vehicle has.
NOTE: If Dog and Sentry are enabled at the same
time, Sentry defaults to Disable Sentry Sounds to

USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos
NOTE: The ability to format, and view video footage on,
USB drives may not be available on your vehicle
depending on date of manufacture and vehicle
configuration.
Some features require you to use a USB drive (for
example, Dashcam, Sentry Mode) that meet these
requirements:
• Minimum storage capacity of 64 GB. Use a USB drive
with as much available storage as possible. Video
footage can occupy a large amount of space.
• A sustained write speed of at least 4 MB/s. Note that
sustained write speed differs from peak write speed.

NOTE: You may need to first enable Sentry Mode (if
equipped) by touching Controls > Sentry.

Viewing Video Recordings
If footage is saved, you can view the clips on the
touchscreen or a computer.
When the USB drive runs out of storage space, video
footage can no longer be saved. To prevent the USB

12. If your Model X is equipped with the medical-grade HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter, this filter ensures
the best quality air inside the cabin whenever the climate control system is on and outside air is entering the
cabin (recirculate is off). The HEPA filter is extremely effective at removing particles, including pollution,
allergens, bacteria, pollen, mold spores, and viruses. Both the HEPA filter and the secondary filtration system also
contain activated carbon to remove a broad spectrum of odors and gases. When you engage Bioweapon Defense
Mode, the positive pressure inside the cabin minimizes the amount of outside air that can enter the vehicle.
NOTE: Some gases, such as carbon monoxide, are not effectively removed by activated carbon.
13. Touch to control the flow of air inside the cabin. Air can be drawn into Model X from outside or air can be
recirculated inside the cabin.
14. Use the slider to adjust the fan speed. When in Auto, the fan speed levels change to Low/ Medium/ High.
NOTE: Adjusting the fan speed may change the selected setting for how air is drawn into Model X in order to
increase or reduce air flow.
15. Touch to turn the air conditioning system on or off. Turning it off reduces cooling, but saves energy.
NOTE: Because Model X runs much quieter than a gasoline-powered vehicle, you may notice the sound of the air
conditioning compressor as it is operating. To minimize noise, reduce the fan speed.
16. Touch to warm up the rear windshield. After 15 minutes, the rear window defroster automatically turns off. The
exterior side mirrors are also heated whenever the rear window defroster is operating.
17. The windshield defroster distributes air flow to the windshield. Touch once to defog the windshield (the icon turns
blue). Touch a second time to defrost the windshield. Touch a third time to turn off and restore the air
distribution, heating, and fan to their previous settings. In cold ambient temperatures, the exterior side mirrors are
also heated whenever the windshield defroster is operating. See Cold Weather Best Practices on page 163 for
more information on preparing for cold weather.

Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp
The Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp settings allow you
to keep the climate control system running when in Park,
even after you've left Model X or choose to stay inside
the vehicle. These settings are useful when it is
important to maintain the cabin temperature in hot or
cold weather conditions. For example, when leaving
groceries in Model X on hot days, you may want to use
Keep Climate On to prevent spoilage.
Dog is designed to maintain a comfortable cabin
temperature for your pet while you actively and
frequently monitor this temperature using the mobile
app (which requires both your phone and the vehicle to
have cellular connectivity). When in Dog, the
touchscreen displays the current cabin temperature to
inform people passing by that your pet is safe. This
setting is not intended for people, and should only be
used for short periods of time while you stay in close
proximity should you need to return to the vehicle in
situations where the temperature can no longer be
maintained.
NOTE: To avoid accidentally pressing the window switch
(such as your dog stepping on it), the windows cannot
be rolled down while Dog is enabled.
158

Camp allows you to power electronics through the USB
ports and low voltage outlet in addition to maintaining
the cabin temperature. The touchscreen remains on so
you can play music, browse the internet, play games in
the arcade, or watch shows in Tesla Theater. You can
also control media and climate settings from a paired
phone. Camp is ideal for remaining inside your vehicle,
such as camping or staying with a child. While active,
Sentry Mode and the vehicle alarm system are disabled.
To operate Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp:
1. Make sure the Battery's charge level is at least 20%.
2. Engage Park. The Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp
settings are available only when Model X is in Park.
3. If necessary, adjust the climate settings.
4. On the climate controls screen, touch Keep Climate
On, Dog, or Camp.
NOTE: You can also control Dog and Camp from the
mobile app, by swiping up from the gray bar on the
Climate screen.
The climate control system attempts to maintain your
climate settings until you shift out of Park or manually
turn it off. Avoid using Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp
when the Battery's charge level is low. If the Battery's
charge level drops below 20%, the Tesla mobile app
attempts to repeatedly send notifications reminding you
to check on anything that you have left in Model X.
NOTE: Software updates cannot be performed when
Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp is active.
NOTE: The intrusion sensor (if equipped) automatically
disables when Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp is active.
However, you can override this behavior and keep the
intrusion sensor enabled. To do so, touch Controls >
Safety > Tilt/Intrusion after enabling Keep Climate On,
Dog, or Camp. However, note that keeping the intrusion
sensor enabled while Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp is
active can trigger an alarm event as a result of air
movement inside the cabin.

Cabin Overheat Protection
Cabin Overheat Protection prevents the cabin from
getting too hot in scorching ambient conditions. While
not necessary to activate whenever you leave Model X,
the climate control system can reduce and maintain the
temperature of your vehicle’s cabin. This can prevent the
cabin from getting too hot after leaving it parked in the
sun, making the vehicle more comfortable when you
return. Cabin Overheat Protection may take up to 15
minutes to enable once you exit the vehicle. This feature
is intended for passenger comfort and has no impact on
the reliability of your vehicle's components.
To turn on, touch Controls > Safety > Cabin Overheat
Protection and choose:
• On: The air conditioning operates when the cabin
temperature exceeds 105° F (40° C), or the selected
temperature if available, on the touchscreen or
mobile app. Customizing temperatures may require
the most recent version of the mobile app.
• Off: Disables Cabin Overheat Protection.
You can also enable Cabin Overheat Protection remotely
through the mobile app by touching Climate. Swipe up
on the bottom menu and select a setting under Cabin
Overheat Protection (see Mobile App on page 63).
Cabin Overheat Protection operates until 12 hours has
elapsed once you exit Model X, or until the Battery
energy drops below 20%, whichever comes first. Using
Cabin Overheat Protection requires energy from the
Battery, which may decrease range.

Climate

WARNING: Due to automatic shut-off, extreme
outside conditions, or other potential inability to
maintain the selected temperature, the inside of
the vehicle can become dangerously hot, even
when Cabin Overheat Protection is enabled. If you
experience temperatures exceeding the selected
temperature repeatedly, contact Tesla service.
WARNING: Never leave children or pets in the
vehicle unattended. Due to automatic shut-off or
extreme outside conditions, the inside of the
vehicle can become dangerously hot, even when
Cabin Overheat Protection is enabled.

Climate Control Operating Tips
• When you use the mobile app to turn on the climate
control system, it automatically turns off when the
charge level drops to 20%, or if two hours has passed.
To cool or heat the cabin for a longer period of time,
charge the vehicle and re-enable your climate control
preference through the mobile app.
• You may hear the sound of the climate system inside
the cabin of Model X when Parked. It makes a low fan
noise. The climate system attempts to dry itself out
to minimize additional moisture or musty odors. This
is a normal operation and not a cause for concern.
• You can improve the efficiency of the cabin heating
by reducing your selected acceleration mode (see
Acceleration Modes on page 95). This allows the heat
pump system to take more heat from the Battery to
efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the
Battery's ability to provide peak acceleration
performance. This helps to maximize driving
efficiency in colder weather. Note that when
subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the
Battery requires time to warm up before the
increased level of acceleration is available.
• If the climate control system is louder than you prefer,
manually reduce the fan speed.
• In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning
compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot
weather, the air conditioning compressor can turn on
even if you turned it off. This is normal because the
system’s priority is to cool the Battery to ensure it
stays within an optimum temperature range to
support longevity and optimum performance.
• Even when not in use, you may hear Model X emit a
whining noise or the sound of water circulating.
These sounds are normal and occur when the internal
cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle
functions, such as maintaining the low voltage
battery and balancing the temperature of the high
voltage Battery.
• To ensure the climate control system operates
efficiently, close all windows and ensure that the
exterior grille in front of the windshield is free of ice,
snow, leaves, and other debris.

159

Operating Climate Controls
• In very humid conditions, it is normal for the
windshield to fog slightly when you first turn on the
air conditioning.
• It is normal for a small pool of water to form under
Model X when parked. Extra water produced by the
dehumidifying process is drained underneath.
• To reduce the temperature in the cabin in hot
weather conditions, the fan may turn on to vent the
cabin when the vehicle is parked. This occurs only if
the battery's charge level is above 20%.

NOTE: When you split a vent into two separate air flows, the air flow in each direction is not as strong as when all air
is flowing in a single direction.
NOTE: Outside air is drawn into Model X through the grill in front of the windshield. Keep the grill clear of
obstructions, such as leaves and snow.

Cabin Air Filter(s)
Model X has one or more air filters to prevent pollen, industrial fallout, road dust and other particles from entering
through the vents.
NOTE: Cabin air filter(s) require periodic replacement. See Service Intervals on page 191.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Cold Weather Best Practices
To ensure that Model X provides you with the best
ownership experience possible in harsh cold weather
conditions, follow these best practices.

Before Driving
When snow and ice accumulate on your vehicle, moving
parts, such as the door handles, windows, mirrors, and
wipers can freeze in place. To achieve maximum range
and performance, it is helpful to warm the cabin and
Battery before you leave. There are several ways to do
so:
• Touch Schedule, available on both the charging and
climate control screens, to set a time when you want
your vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled
Charging and Scheduled Departure on page 186).
• In the mobile app, navigate to Climate to customize
the temperature at which you want to heat the cabin.
This also warms the high voltage Battery as needed.
• In the mobile app, navigate to Climate > Defrost Car
to melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield,
windows, and mirrors. This also warms the high
voltage Battery as needed.
NOTE: Tesla recommends activating climate settings
at least 30-45 minutes before departure (see
Operating Climate Controls on page 156).
Preconditioning times depend on outside
temperature and other factors. The mobile app will
notify you once your vehicle has reached the desired
preconditioning temperature.

Charge Port
• If your charge port latch freezes in place and a
charging cable becomes stuck in the charge port, try
manually releasing the charge cable. See Manually
Releasing Charge Cable on page 185.
• In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is
possible that your charge port latch may freeze in
place. In cases where you cannot remove or insert the
charge cable, or the vehicle is not Supercharging due
to the latch being frozen in place, use the Defrost Car
setting in the mobile app. This can help thaw ice on
the charge port latch so the charge cable can be
removed or inserted.
NOTE: You can also prevent the occurrence of a charge
port latch freezing in place by using the Schedule
settings (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled
Departure on page 186).
NOTE: If your charge port latch is frozen in place, it may
not lock the charging cable in place when inserted, but it
can still charge at a slow AC rate even if the latch is not
engaged.

Climate

Charging
By using Trip Planner (if available in your market region)
to navigate to a Tesla charging location, Model X preheats the high voltage battery to ensure when you arrive
at the charger, the temperature of the battery is optimal
and ready to charge. This reduces the amount of time it
takes to charge. See (see Trip Planner on page 169).
NOTE: Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate
to a charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before
arrival to ensure optimal battery temperature and
charging conditions. If the drive to the charging location
is less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the
battery before driving (see Before Driving on page 163).
NOTE: The thermal system may produce steam under
certain conditions. For example, odorless steam can
come from the front of your vehicle while charging at a
Supercharger in cold temperature. This is normal and
not a cause for concern.

Windows
• In the mobile app, go to Climate, swipe up from the
bottom and select Defrost Car, which helps melt
snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, windows, and
mirrors.
• In cold temperatures, Model X automatically makes a
slight adjustment to the position of the windows to
make it easier to open doors.
NOTE: Always connect to an external, low voltage
power supply before opening a door when the
vehicle has no power to avoid breaking a window.
• Use the mobile app to schedule a service
appointment for Tesla to provide hydrophobic
coating to the side and rear windows (not the front)
for a nominal fee.

Mirrors
If ice buildup is expected when parking, turn off AutoFold Mirrors. Touch Controls > Auto-Fold. Ice can
prevent exterior side mirrors from folding or unfolding.
NOTE: Side mirrors automatically heat as needed during
preconditioning, or when the rear defroster is turned on.

Wipers
If you expect snow or ice to build up when parked, touch
Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode. This raises
wipers against the windshield so they can defrost when
the windshield defrosts (see Wipers and Washers on
page 85). You can also turn on wiper defrosters (if
equipped). See Operating Climate Controls on page 156.

163

Cold Weather Best Practices
Tires and Tire Chains
• Use winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy
conditions. You can purchase winter tires on http://
www.tesla.com (see Seasonal Tire Types on page
197).
• Tire chains provide additional traction when driving in
snowy or icy conditions. Check local regulations to
determine if tire chains are recommended or required
during winter months. See Using Tire Chains on page
198 for more information.
Your vehicle’s tire pressures will drop in cold ambient
temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light appears, inflate
the tires before driving. The tires will lose one PSI for
every 10° F (6° C) drop in outside temperature (see Tire
Care and Maintenance on page 193). Proper tire
pressures help protect tires from potholes and improve
range when properly inflated.

While Driving
Cold weather can increase energy consumption because
more power is required for driving, cabin and Battery
heating. Follow these suggestions to reduce energy
consumption:
• Use seat heaters to keep warm. Seat heaters use less
energy than the cabin heater. Lowering the cabin
temperature and using seat heaters reduces energy
consumption (see Operating Climate Controls on
page 156).
• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid
acceleration.
• You can improve the efficiency of the cabin heating
by reducing your selected acceleration mode (see
Acceleration Modes on page 95). This allows the heat
pump system to take more heat from the Battery to
efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the
Battery's ability to provide peak acceleration
performance. This helps to maximize driving
efficiency in colder weather. Note that when
subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the
Battery requires time to warm up before the
increased level of acceleration is available.

Regenerative Braking
Regenerative braking can be limited if the Battery is too
cold. As you continue to drive, the Battery warms up
and regenerative power increases (see Regenerative
Braking on page 87).

NOTE: Installing winter tires can result in temporarily
reduced regenerative braking power but after a short
period of driving, Model X recalibrates to correct this.
Touch Service > Wheel & Tire > Tires to select winter
tires and quicken this process.

Blue Snowflake Icon
A blue snowflake icon appears on your
instrument panel when some of the stored
energy in the Battery is unavailable because the
Battery is cold. This portion of unavailable
energy displays in blue on the Battery meter.
Regenerative braking, acceleration, and charging
rates may be limited. The snowflake icon no
longer displays when the Battery is sufficiently
warm.

After Driving
Leave Model X plugged in when not in use. This uses the
charging system, rather than the battery itself, to keep
the battery warm (see High Voltage Battery Information
on page 179).

Scheduled Departure
When parked, plug in Model X and use the Schedule
settings, available on both the charging and climate
control screens, to set a time when you want to
precondition Model X (see Scheduled Charging and
Scheduled Departure on page 186). Your vehicle
determines the appropriate time to begin charging so it
is complete during off-peak hours and the cabin and
Battery are warm by your set departure time. For more
information, see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled
Departure on page 186.

Storage
If you leave Model X parked for an extended period of
time, plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal
range loss and to keep the Battery at an optimal
temperature. Your vehicle is safe to stay plugged in for
any length of time.
When not in use, Model X enters a sleep mode to
conserve energy. Reduce the number of times you check
your vehicle’s status on the mobile app, as this
automatically wakes up your vehicle and starts normal
energy consumption.

NOTE: Limited regenerative braking can be avoided if
you allow enough time to precondition your vehicle or if
you use Schedule to precondition Model X before your
departure time (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled
Departure on page 186).

the associated amenity.
• Touch the arrow icon to navigate to the charging
location.
NOTE: When navigating to a Supercharger (or thirdparty fast charger in some regions), Model X
preconditions the Battery to prepare for charging.
This ensures you arrive with an optimal Battery
temperature, reducing the amount of time it takes to
charge. In some circumstances (such as cold
weather), it is normal for the motor(s) and
components to make noise as it generates heat to
warm the Battery (see Charging on page 163).

NOTE: Some factors that contribute to predicted energy
(such as forecasted temperatures and wind speed) are
available only when Model X has internet connectivity.

• A red warning displays when you must charge to
reach your destination.
To determine if you have enough energy for a round trip,
touch the Battery icon on the turn-by-turn direction list
to display an estimated calculation of your round trip
energy usage.

Predicting Energy Usage

Trip Planner

When navigating to a destination, Model X helps you
anticipate your charging needs by calculating the
amount of energy that remains when you reach your
destination. When navigating, the map displays this
calculation next to the Battery icon on the turn-by-turn
direction list (see Navigating to a Destination on page
166). When the turn-by-turn direction list is compressed,
touch the top of the list to expand it.

Trip Planner (if available in your market region) helps
you take longer road trips with confidence. If reaching
your destination requires charging, Trip Planner routes
you through the appropriate Supercharger locations.
Trip Planner selects a route and provides charging times
to minimize the amount of time you spend driving and
charging. To enable Trip Planner, touch the map's
settings icon (see Navigation Settings on page 166),
then touch Trip Planner.

The calculation that predicts how much energy you will
use is an estimate based on driving style (predicted
speed, etc.) and environmental factors (elevation
changes, wind speed and direction, ambient and
forecasted temperatures, air density and humidity, etc.).
As you drive, Model X continuously learns how much
energy it uses, resulting in improved accuracy over time.
It is important to note that Model X predicts energy
usage based on the driving style of the individual
vehicle. For example, if you drive aggressively for a
period of time, future range predictions will assume
higher consumption. Also, if you purchase a used Tesla
vehicle, it is recommended that you perform a factory
reset (Controls > Service > Factory Reset) to ensure the
predicted energy is as accurate as possible.

Navigation and Entertainment

When Trip Planner is enabled and charging is required to
reach your destination, the turn-by-turn direction list
includes Supercharger stops, recommended charging
times at each Supercharger, and an estimate of how
much energy will be available when you arrive at the
Supercharger location.
NOTE: When navigating to a Supercharger or, in some
regions, a third-party fast charger using Trip Planner,
Model X may allocate some energy to pre-heat the
Battery to arrive at the Supercharger or third-party fast
charger with an optimal Battery temperature. This
reduces charging time (see Charging on page 163).

Maps and Navigation
To remove Supercharger stops and display directions
only, touch Remove all charging stops at the bottom of
the turn-by-turn direction list. If you remove charging
stops, the turn-by-turn direction list may display an alert
indicating that charging is needed to reach your
destination. To add Supercharger stops back to the turnby-turn direction list, touch Add charging stops.
While charging at a Supercharger, the charging screen
displays the remaining charging time needed to drive to
your next Supercharger stop, or destination (if no
further charging is needed). If you charge for a shorter
or longer length of time, charging time at subsequent
Supercharger stops is adjusted accordingly.
NOTE: You can also use the mobile app to monitor
remaining charging time needed.
NOTE: If a Supercharger on your navigation route
experiences an outage, Trip Planner displays a
notification and attempts to reroute you to a different
Supercharger location.
If Trip Planner estimates that you won't have enough
energy for your round trip, and there are no
Superchargers available on your route, Trip Planner
displays an alert at the top of the turn-by-turn direction
list notifying you that charging is needed to reach your
destination.

Map Updates
As updated maps become available, they are
automatically sent to Model X over Wi-Fi. To ensure you
receive them, periodically connect Model X to a Wi-Fi

MODEL X Owner's Manual

High Voltage Battery Information
About the High Voltage Battery
Model X has one of the most sophisticated battery
systems in the world. The most important way to
preserve the high voltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR
VEHICLE PLUGGED IN when you are not using it. This is
particularly important if you are not planning to drive
Model X for several weeks.

supporting the onboard electronics and auxiliary low
voltage battery. Once this low-power consumption
mode is active, immediately plug in Model X to prevent a
jump start and low voltage battery replacement.
NOTE: If Model X is unresponsive and does not unlock,
open, or charge, the low voltage battery may be
discharged. In this situation, try jump starting the low
voltage battery (see Jump Starting on page 229). If the
vehicle is still unresponsive, contact Tesla.

NOTE: When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle
periodically uses energy from the Battery for system
tests and recharging the low voltage battery when
necessary.

Temperature Limits

There is no advantage to waiting until the Battery’s level
is low before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best
when charged regularly.

For better long-term performance, avoid exposing
Model X to ambient temperatures above 140° F (60° C)
or below -22° F (-30° C) for more than 24 hours at a
time.

NOTE: If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other
components may become damaged or require
replacement (for example, the low voltage battery). In
these cases, you are responsible for repair and/or
transporting expenses. Discharge-related expenses are
not covered by the warranty or under the Roadside
Assistance policy.
The peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease
slightly after a large number of DC Fast Charging
sessions, such as those at Superchargers. To ensure
maximum driving range and Battery safety, the Battery
charge rate is decreased when the Battery is too cold,
when the Battery’s charge is nearly full, and when the
Battery conditions change with usage and age. These
changes in the condition of the Battery are driven by
battery physics and may increase the total
Supercharging duration by a few minutes over time. You
can minimize the amount of charge time by using Trip
Planner (if available in your market region) to warm the
Battery while driving to a Supercharger. See Trip Planner
on page 169 for more information.

Battery Care
Never allow the Battery to fully discharge. Even when
Model X is not being driven, its Battery discharges very
slowly to power the onboard electronics. The Battery
can discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day,
though the discharge rate may vary depending on
environmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle
configuration, and your selected settings on the
touchscreen. Situations can arise in which you must
leave Model X unplugged for an extended period of time
(for example, at an airport when traveling). In these
situations, keep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave
the Battery with a sufficient charge level. For example,
over a two week period (14 days), the Battery may
discharge by approximately 14%.
Discharging the Battery to 0% may result in damage to
vehicle components. To protect against a complete
discharge, Model X enters a low-power consumption
mode when the displayed charge level drops to
approximately 0%. In this mode, the Battery stops
Charging and Energy Consumption

Energy Saving Feature
Model X has an energy-saving feature that reduces the
amount of energy being consumed by the displays when
Model X is not in use. On newer vehicles, this feature is
automated to provide an optimal level of energy saving.
However, on older vehicles, you can control the amount
of energy being consumed by the displays by touching
Controls > Display > Energy Saving. For more
information on maximizing range and saving energy, see
Getting Maximum Range on page 187.

Submerged Vehicle
As with any electric vehicle, if your Tesla has been
exposed to flooding, extreme weather events or has
otherwise been submerged in water (especially in salt
water), treat it as if it’s been in an accident and contact
your insurance company for support. Do not attempt to
operate the vehicle before Tesla Service has inspected it,
but you should tow or move it away from any structures.
NOTE: Damage caused by water is not covered under
warranty.

Battery Warnings and Cautions
WARNING: The Battery has no parts that an owner
or a non-Tesla authorized service technician can
service. Under no circumstances should you open
or tamper with the Battery. Always contact Tesla
to arrange for Battery servicing.
CAUTION: If the Battery’s charge level falls to 0%,
you must plug it in. If you leave it unplugged for an
extended period, it may not be possible to charge
or use Model X without jump starting or replacing
the low voltage battery. Leaving Model X
unplugged for an extended period can also result
in permanent Battery damage. If you are unable to
charge Model X after attempting to jump start the
low voltage battery, contact Tesla immediately.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Charging Instructions
Opening the Charge Port
The charge port is located on the left side of Model X,
behind a door that is part of the rear tail light assembly.
Park Model X to ensure that the charge cable easily
reaches the charge port.
With Model X in Park, press and release the button on
the Tesla charge cable to open the charge port door.

NOTE: The charge port lights up white when you open
the charge port door. If you do not insert a charge cable
into the charge port within a few minutes after opening
the charge port door, the charge port door closes. If this
happens, use the touchscreen to open the charge port
door again.
NOTE: In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is
possible that your charge port latch may freeze in place.
In cases where you cannot remove or insert the charge
cable, or the vehicle is not Supercharging due to the
latch being frozen in place, use your Tesla mobile app to
precondition your vehicle on HI for approximately 30-45
minutes (you must use your mobile app to precondition
the vehicle; setting your climate to HI using the
touchscreen is not effective). This can help thaw ice on
the charge port latch so the charge cable can be
removed or inserted.
CAUTION: Do not try to force the charge port
door open.

Plugging In
You can also open the charge port door using any of
these methods:
• On the touchscreen, touch Controls and touch the
Charge Port icon (lightning bolt).
• On the touchscreen, navigate to Controls > Charging
> Open Charge Port.
• Press the charge port door when Model X is
unlocked.
• On the key fob, hold down the rear trunk button for
1-2 seconds.
• Use voice commands to open the charge port door
(see Voice Commands on page 20). You can also use
voice commands to close the charge port door, and
begin or stop charging.
NOTE: The following image is provided for
demonstration purposes only. Depending on market
region and date of manufacture, your charge port may
be slightly different.

If desired, use the touchscreen to change the charge
limit and the charging current (see Charge Settings on
page 183).
To charge at a public charging station, plug the
appropriate adapter into the vehicle's charging port, and
then connect the station's charging connector to the
adapter. The most commonly used adapter(s) for each
market region are provided. Depending on the charging
equipment you are using, you may need to start and
stop charging using a control on the charging
equipment.
If you are using the Mobile Connector, plug into the
power outlet before plugging in Model X.
Align the connector to the charge port and insert fully.
When the connector is properly inserted, charging
begins automatically after Model X:
• Engages a latch that holds the connector in place;
• Shifts into Park (if it was in any other drive mode);
• Heats or cools the Battery, if needed. If the Battery
requires heating or cooling, you may notice a delay
before charging begins.

Charging and Energy Consumption

181

Charging Instructions
NOTE: Whenever Model X is plugged in but not actively
charging, it draws energy from the wall outlet instead of
using energy stored in the Battery. For example, if you
are sitting in Model X and using the touchscreen while
parked and plugged in, Model X draws energy from the
wall outlet instead of the Battery.

• BLUE: The charger is connected, but Model X is not
charging (such as when scheduled charging is
active).

When the Battery reaches the set charge limit, however,
Model X draws energy directly from the Battery. Once
the Battery discharges enough, it starts charging to
reach the limit again. Sometimes the Battery may not
discharge enough to trigger a charge cycle and is
slightly under the charge limit even after being plugged
in for a long period. This is normal. To start a new charge
cycle manually, unplug and then plug in Model X.

• BLINKING GREEN: Charging is in progress. As
Model X approaches a full charge, the frequency of
the blinking slows.

CAUTION: The connector end of the charge cable
can damage the paint if you drop it onto Model X.

Charge Port Light

• BLINKING BLUE: Model X is communicating with the
charger, but has not started charging yet (such as
when your vehicle is preparing to charge).

• SOLID GREEN: Charging is complete.
• SOLID AMBER: The connector is not fully plugged in.
Realign the connector to the charge port and insert
fully.
• BLINKING AMBER: Model X is charging at a reduced
current (AC charging only).
• RED: A fault is detected and charging has stopped.
Check the instrument panel or touchscreen for an
alert.

• WHITE (OR LIGHT BLUE): The charge port door is
open. Model X is ready to charge and the connector
is not inserted, or the charge port latch is unlocked
and the connector is ready to be removed.

Charging Status
Charging status displays on the instrument panel when the charge port door is open.

1. Time remaining: The estimated time remaining to charge to your set limit (see Charge Settings on page 183).
NOTE: When charging to 100%, the vehicle may continue to charge with low power when charging is displayed as
complete. This is expected operation. Because the added energy beyond this point is low, it is usually not
beneficial to continue charging.
2. Charging: The current power of the charger.
182

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Charging Instructions
3. Charging rate: The current charging speed that the vehicle is charging.
4. Range gained: Estimated increase in driving distance achieved in the charging session.
5. Driving distance: Displays the total estimated driving distance or energy percentage (depending on your display
setting) available.
NOTE: To change how energy units are displayed, touch Controls > Display > Energy Display.
6. Charge status: Charge status messages (such as Supercharging, Scheduled Charging) display here (see
Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure on page 186).

During Charging
During charging, the charge port light pulses green, and
the touchscreen displays real-time charging status. The
frequency at which the green charge port light pulses
slows down as the charge level approaches full. When
charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is solid
green.
NOTE: If Model X is locked, the charge port light does
not light up.
If the charge port light turns red while charging, a fault
is detected. Check the instrument panel or touchscreen
for an alert describing the fault. A fault can occur due to
something as common as a power outage. If a power
outage occurs, charging resumes automatically when
power is restored.
NOTE: The thermal system may produce steam under
certain conditions. For example, odorless steam can
come from the front of your vehicle while charging at a
Supercharger in cold temperature. This is normal and
not a cause for concern.
NOTE: It is normal to hear sounds during charging.
Particularly at high currents, the refrigerant compressor
and fan operate as needed to keep the Battery cool.
NOTE: Air conditioning performance is generally not
affected by charging. However, in some circumstances
(for example, charging at high currents during a
particularly warm day), the air coming from the vents
may not be as cool as expected and a message displays
on the instrument panel. This is normal and ensures that
the Battery stays within an optimum temperature range
while charging to support longevity and optimum
performance.
WARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity
(for example, a pressure washer) towards the
charge port while charging. Doing so can result in
serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging
equipment, or property.

Stopping Charging
Stop charging at any time by disconnecting the charge
cable or touching Stop Charging on the touchscreen.

NOTE: To prevent unauthorized unplugging of the
charge cable, the charge cable latch remains locked and
Model X must be unlocked or able to recognize your key
before you can disconnect the charge cable.
To disconnect the charge cable:
1. Press and hold the button on the connector handle to
release the latch.
NOTE: You can also release the latch using the
touchscreen or mobile app, or by pressing and
holding the rear trunk button on the key fob. If your
vehicle is equipped with a motorized charge port,
you can also press the button to the left of the
charge port to release the latch.
2. Pull the connector from the charge port. The charge
port door automatically closes.
To disconnect the charge cable when using an adapter
at a public charge station:
1. Unlock Model X.
2. While holding the public charging handle in one hand
and the adapter in the other hand, press and hold the
button on the public charging handle and pull both
outwards, removing the handle and adapter at the
same time.
NOTE: If the charging station handle separates from
the adapter, leaving the adapter in Model X, use the
touchscreen to unlock the charge port.
3. Press and hold the button on the charging handle
again to release the adapter from the public charging
handle.
NOTE: The charge port door automatically closes within
approximately 10 seconds of removing the connector
from the charge port.
CAUTION: Tesla strongly recommends leaving
Model X plugged in when not in use. This
maintains the Battery at the optimum level of
charge.

Charge Settings
Access charge settings by touching Controls > Charging
when Model X is in Park.

Navigation and Entertainment

183

Charging Instructions
When charging, you can also touch the
charge icon on the touchscreen to access
charge settings.

1. Driving distance: Displays the total estimated driving
distance available.
2. Set limit: Adjust the charge slider to the level of
charging you want. The setting you choose applies to
immediate and scheduled charging sessions.
NOTE: A portion of the battery image may appear
blue. This indicates that a small portion of the energy
stored in the battery is not available because the
battery is cold. This is normal and no reason for
concern. When the battery warms up, the blue
portion no longer displays.
You can further adjust charge settings:
• Charge current at this location: The current
automatically sets to the maximum current available
from the attached charge cable, unless it was
previously reduced to a lower level. If needed, touch or + to change the current (for example, you may
want to reduce the current if you are concerned
about overloading a domestic wiring circuit shared
by other equipment). It is not possible to set the
charging current to a level that exceeds the maximum
available from the attached charge cable. When you
change the current, Model X remembers the location.
If you charge at the same location, you do not need
to change it again.
When charging using the Mobile Connector with
domestic outlets, your vehicle may automatically
select a default charge current. Override this default
current to a higher setting by customizing Charge
Current at this location or through the mobile app.

NOTE: If Model X is charging and detects unexpected
ﬂuctuations in input power, the charging current is
automatically reduced by 25%. For example, a
40 amp current is reduced to 30 amps. This
automatic current reduction increases robustness and
safety in situations when an external problem exists
(for example, a home wiring system, receptacle,
adapter or cord is unable to meet its rated current
capacity). As a precaution, when Model X
automatically reduces current, it saves the reduced
current at the charging location. Although you can
manually increase it, Tesla recommends charging at
the lower current until the underlying problem is
resolved and the charging location can provide
consistent power.
• Open Charge Port, Unlock Charge Port and Stop
Charging: When not charging, touch Open Charge
Port or Unlock Charge Port to open the charge port
door or to unlock the charge cable from the charge
port. Use Stop Charging when you are finished
charging.
• Schedule: Depending on the setting you select by
touching Switch to Scheduled Departure/Scheduled
Charging, this displays either a departure time for
when the vehicle should be preconditioned and/or
charged by or a time to start charging (see
Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure on
page 186).
• Supercharging: Displays supercharger usage fees, the
location, the time that charging started, and a cost
estimate for the session (see Supercharger Usage
Fees and Idle Fees on page 184).
NOTE: To reduce congestion at high-usage
supercharger sites, you may be limited to a maximum
charge of 80% when not using Trip Planner (if
available in your market region). See Trip Planner on
page 169).

Supercharger Usage Fees and Idle
Fees
When charging at a Tesla supercharger, information
about the charging session displays at the bottom of the
charging screen. This includes the location, the time that
charging started, and a cost estimate for the session.
When you stop supercharging, the estimated cost of the
session displays until a new supercharging session
begins. If free charging is applicable, the estimated cost
displays as zero.
NOTE: Estimated cost may not reflect the final cost of
the supercharging session. Final pricing for
supercharging sessions can be found in your Tesla
account.
When charging at a Tesla supercharger, you are subject
to idle fees. Idle fees are designed to encourage drivers
to move their vehicle from the Supercharger when
charging is complete. Idle fees are in effect only when
half or more of the Superchargers at a site are occupied.

184

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Charging Instructions
The Tesla mobile app notifies you when charging is
almost complete, and again when charging is complete.
Additional notifications are sent if idle fees are incurred.
Idle fees are waived if you move your vehicle within five
minutes of when charging completed.
Log into your Tesla account to view fees and details
about Supercharger sessions, track the remaining
balance of free credits, set up a payment method, and
make payments. Once a payment method is saved, fees
are automatically paid from your account.

WARNING: Do not pull the release cable while
simultaneously attempting to remove the
charge cable from the charge port. Always pull
the release cable before attempting to remove
the charge cable. Failure to follow these
instructions can result in electric shock and
serious injury.

Charging Best Practices
• If you are able, maintain a regular charging routine
using a low-voltage charger such as a Wall Connector
at your home.
• Avoid allowing the battery to get too low.
• Only use DC Fast Charging (such as Supercharging)
when necessary, such as during long road trips.
• Charge the battery to the appropriate charge limit for
Model X based on the installed battery (see Electric
Vehicle Components on page 177). To adjust the
charge limit, navigate to the charging screen and
select Set Limit or use the mobile app to drag the
charging slider.
• For RWD vehicles: Tesla recommends you keep your
charge limit to 100%, even for daily use, and you
regularly charge your vehicle to 100%. If Model X has
been parked for longer than a week, drive your
vehicle as you normally would and charge to 100% at
your earliest convenience.
• For AWD vehicles: keep the full charge limit of the
battery to under 90% for Daily use. If you need 100%
of your battery for a long-distance trip, increase the
limit for Trip as needed.

NOTE: The release cable may be recessed within the
opening of the trim.
4. Pull the charge cable from the charge port.
CAUTION: Use the release cable only in situations
where you can not release the charge cable using
the usual methods. Continuous use can damage
the release cable or charging equipment.
WARNING: Do not perform this procedure when
your vehicle is charging, or if any orange high
voltage conductors are exposed. Failure to follow
these instructions can result in electric shock and
serious injury or damage to the vehicle. If you are
uncertain as to how to safely perform this
procedure, contact your nearest Service Center.

Manually Releasing Charge Cable
If the usual methods for releasing a charge cable from
the charge port (using the charge handle release button,
touchscreen, or mobile app) do not work, try pressing
and holding down the rear trunk button on the key fob
(if equipped) for 1-2 seconds. If it still doesn't release,
carefully follow these steps:
1. Ensure that Model X is not actively charging by
displaying the charging screen on the touchscreen. If
necessary, touch Stop Charging.
2. Open the rear trunk.
3. Pull the charge port's release cable downwards to
unlatch the charge cable.

Charging and Energy Consumption

185

Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure
Toggle between Scheduled Departure and Scheduled
Charging by touching Controls > Charging > Switch to
Scheduled Charging/Scheduled Departure when
Model X is in Park.
NOTE: Scheduled Charging/Scheduled Departure
settings are also available on the Climate Controls
screen and in the Tesla mobile app.
Think of Scheduled Charging as "When do I want
charging to start?" and think of Scheduled Departure
Off-Peak Charging which is "When do I want charging to
be complete?"
Scheduled Charging can be used together with
Scheduled Departure Preconditioning but not with
Scheduled Departure Off-Peak Charging.
Scheduled Charging/Scheduled Departure settings are
automatically saved for each location.
NOTE: If you plug in Model X with both Off-Peak
Charging and Scheduled Charging deselected, your
vehicle charges immediately.

Using Scheduled Charging
Use Scheduled Charging to specify a daily time in which
you want Model X to start charging.
With Scheduled Charging selected, enable the feature
then set a daily time to start charging.

NOTE: When Model X is not plugged in,
preconditioning operates but only when the Battery's
charge level is above 20%.
• Off-Peak Charging delays charging and automatically
starts charging in order to finish before your
scheduled departure time while also ensuring to
charge the Battery during off-peak hours to reduce
energy costs. Touch Change Off-Peak Hours to
customize the time when off-peak utility rates end.
NOTE: Choosing Off-Peak Charging can reduce
energy costs even in market regions where off-peak
utility rates are not applicable. For example, if
charging starts as soon as you plug in, charging may
complete much sooner. This causes the Battery to
cool down to ambient temperatures and requires
energy to warm it back up by your departure time.
Therefore, even if off-peak utility rates are not
applicable to you, it is recommended that you set
Off-Peak Hours to the same time as your departure
time in order to reduce energy consumption.
NOTE: If there is not enough time to reach the charge
limit, charging starts immediately in order to charge
as much as possible.
NOTE: Once charging has started and there is not
enough time to complete charging during off-peak
hours, charging continues until the charge limit is
reached.
You can limit Preconditioning and Off-Peak Charging to
weekdays only.

NOTE: Scheduled Charging starts charging immediately
if Model X is plugged in up to six hours after the
scheduled start time. However, if Model X is plugged in
after six hours of the scheduled charging time, charging
may not start until the scheduled time on the next day.

Using Scheduled Departure
Use Scheduled Departure to set a daily time when you
want Model X to be ready to drive. Model X
automatically calculates when it needs to start
preconditioning and/or charging. This ensures that
charging is complete and/or the cabin climate and
Battery are preconditioned by your departure time.
When Scheduled Departure is displayed, touch
Schedule to set a daily time when you want Model X to
be ready to drive. Specify a time, then touch Settings to
enable one or both of the following departure features.
When plugging in with Off-Peak Charging enabled, the
vehicle briefly draws power (you may hear clicking) to
calculate the necessary charging start time.
After you’ve specified your desired settings, touch Set.
The touchscreen displays your scheduled departure
time.
• Preconditioning warms the Battery for improved
performance and ensures a comfortable cabin
climate at your set departure time.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Getting Maximum Range
Factors Affecting Energy
Consumption
While driving:
• Elevated driving speed.
• Environmental conditions such as cold or hot weather
and wind.
• Using climate controls to heat or cool the cabin.
• Uphill travel: Driving uphill requires more energy and
depletes range at a faster rate. However, driving
downhill allows your vehicle to regain a portion of its
expended energy through regenerative braking (see
Regenerative Braking on page 87).
• Short trips or stop-and-go traffic: It takes energy to
bring the cabin and Battery to a specified
temperature when starting the vehicle. You may see a
higher average consumption when the vehicle is used
for very short trips or in heavy traffic.

• Limit the use of resources such as heating and air
conditioning. Using seat and steering yoke (or
steering wheel) heaters (if equipped) to keep warm is
more efficient than heating the cabin using climate
controls.
• With your vehicle plugged in, use the mobile app to
precondition your vehicle to ensure the cabin is at a
comfortable temperature and windows are defrosted
(if needed) before your drive by touching Climate >
On and customizing your preferences (see Mobile
App on page 63).
• Touch Schedule, available on both the charging and
climate control screens, to set a time when you want
your vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled
Charging and Scheduled Departure on page 186).
• Ensure the wheels are aligned to specification, the
tires are kept at the recommended inflation pressures
(see Tire Care and Maintenance on page 193), and are
rotated when needed (see Maintenance Service
Intervals on page 191).

• Heavy cargo load.

• Lighten your load by removing any unnecessary
cargo.

• Windows rolled down.

• Fully raise all windows.

• Wheels and tires not maintained.

• Features such as Sentry Mode and Cabin Overheat
Protection can impact range. Disable features when
not needed.

• Customized settings or third-party accessories (roof
or trunk racks, third-party wheels).
While parked and not plugged in to a charger:
• Preconditioning the cabin or using climate controls.
• Summon.
• Vehicle infotainment and climate controls system.
• Sentry mode.
• Tesla or third-party mobile app requests.

Tips to Maximize Range

• To prevent an excessive amount of energy
consumption while the vehicle is idle, keep the
vehicle plugged in when not in use.
• Minimize the use of DC chargers (such as
Superchargers) for optimal Battery health.
It is normal for estimated range to decrease slightly over
the first few months before leveling off. Over time, you
may see a gradual, but natural, decrease in range at full
charge – this depends on factors such as Supercharging
regularly or the mileage and age of the Battery. Your
Model X will inform you in the unlikely event a hardware
issue is causing excessive Battery or range degradation.

You can maximize your driving range using the same
driving habits you use to conserve fuel in a gasolinepowered vehicle. To achieve maximum range:

Range Assurance

• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid
acceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (touch
Controls > Pedals & Steering > Acceleration) and
Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 148) to assist
in controlling your acceleration and speed.

The driving range displayed in Model X is an estimate of
the remaining battery energy based on EPA-rated
consumption. It may not account for your personal
driving patterns or external conditions. The displayed
range on the instrument panel may decrease faster than
the actual distance driven.

• If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal
instead of using the brake pedal when gradually
slowing down. Whenever Model X is moving and you
are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative
braking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus
energy back to the Battery (see Regenerative Braking
on page 87).

Charging and Energy Consumption

NOTE: Rated driving range is based on EPA-rated
consumption in the United States, which deviates from
tests advertised and performed in other jurisdictions.
Model X helps protect you against running out of
energy. Your vehicle continuously monitors its energy
level and proximity to known charging locations.

187

Getting Maximum Range
Touch Chargers in the Navigation search
bar to toggle between types of chargers,
including Superchargers and destination

wipers and washers are working.
• Check for any unexpected indicator lights or vehicle
alerts on the touchscreen or instrument panel.
• Check the operation of the brakes, including the
parking brake.
• Check the operation of the seat belts (see Seat Belts
on page 45).
• Look for abnormal fluid deposits underneath Model X
that might indicate a leak. It is normal for a small pool
of water to form (caused by the air conditioning
system’s dehumidifying process).
• Look around the exterior of Model X and immediately
remove any corrosive substances (such as bird
droppings, tree resin, tar spots, dead insects,
industrial fallout, etc.) to prevent damage to the paint
(see Cleaning on page 199).

Weekly Checks

NOTE: Damages or failures caused by maintenance or
repairs performed by non-Tesla certified technicians are
not covered by the warranty.

• During wet weather, clean Autopilot cameras weekly

• Check windshield washer fluid level and top up if
necessary (see Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid
on page 203).

• Photos, sound recordings, or videos.
• Date(s), time(s), and time zone when the issue
occurred.

• Check that the air conditioning system is operating
correctly (see Operating Climate Controls on page
156).

• Country of use and location.

Maintenance

191

Maintenance Service Intervals
NOTE: In addition to cooling the interior, the air
conditioning compressor also cools the Battery.
Therefore, in hot weather, the air conditioning
compressor can turn on even if you turned it off. This is
normal because the system’s priority is to cool the
Battery to ensure it stays within an optimum
temperature range to support longevity and optimum
performance. Also, even when not in use, you may hear
Model X emit a whining noise or the sound of water
circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when
the internal cooling systems turn on to support various
vehicle functions, such as maintaining the low voltage
battery and balancing the temperature of the high
voltage Battery.
WARNING: Contact Tesla immediately if you notice
any significant or sudden drop in fluid levels or
uneven tire wear.

Fluid Replacement Intervals

• If a collision occurs, do not touch any high voltage
wiring, connectors, or components connected to the
wiring.
• In the unlikely event that a fire occurs, immediately
contact your local fire emergency responders.
WARNING: Always disconnect the charge cable
before working underneath Model X, even if
charging is not in progress.
WARNING: Keep your hands and clothing away
from cooling fans. Some fans operate even when
Model X is powered off.
WARNING: Some fluids (battery acid, Battery
coolant, brake fluid, windshield washer additives,
etc.) used in vehicles are poisonous and should not
be inhaled, swallowed, or brought into contact
with open wounds. For your safety, always read
and follow instructions printed on fluid containers.

Battery coolant and brake fluid levels should only be
checked by Tesla or a professional automotive repair
shop. Specific service information is available in the
Service Manual.
• Battery coolant: Your Battery coolant does not need
to be replaced for the life of your vehicle under most
circumstances.
NOTE: Any damage caused by opening the Battery
coolant reservoir is excluded from the warranty.
• Brake fluid: Do not top up your brake fluid.

Software
Updating software is important to ensure proper
operation and longevity of your vehicle's components.
You must install a software update at the earliest
opportunity. See Software Updates on page 189.
Tesla may update or reinstall your vehicle's software as
part of the normal diagnostic, repair, and maintenance
process within Service.

High Voltage Safety
Your Model X has been designed and built with safety as
a priority. However, be aware of these precautions to
protect yourself from the risk of injury inherent in all
high-voltage systems:
• Read and follow all instructions provided on the
labels that are attached to Model X. These labels are
there for your safety.
• The high voltage system has no user-serviceable
parts. Do not disassemble, remove or replace high
voltage components, cables or connectors. High
voltage cables are colored orange for easy
identification.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Tire Care and Maintenance
Displaying Tire Pressures
Tire pressures display on the touchscreen by touching
Controls > Service. The pressure of each tire displays in
the visualization of your Model X, in addition to what
time your tire pressures were last measured. You can
choose whether you want to display tire pressures using
Bar or PSI by touching Controls > Display > Tire
Pressure. The touchscreen also displays your vehicle's
recommended cold tire pressures so you can easily
determine how much to inflate your tires.
NOTE: You may need to drive briefly before the
visualization displays the tire pressure values.

Maintaining Tire Pressures
Keep tires inflated to the pressures shown on the Tire
and Loading Information label, even if it differs from the
pressure printed on the tire itself. The Tire and Loading
Information label is located on the center door pillar and
is visible when the driver door is open.
If you are towing a trailer, do not use the tire pressures
printed on the Tire and Loading Information Label.
Instead, refer to the tire pressures published in the
towing section (see Towing and Accessories on page
101).

The Tire Pressure indicator light does not immediately
turn off when you adjust tire pressure. After inflating the
tire to the recommended pressure, you must drive over
15 mph (25 km/h) for a short amount of time to activate
the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), which turns
off the Tire Pressure indicator light.
If the indicator light flashes for one minute whenever
you power on Model X, a fault with the TPMS is detected
(see TPMS Malfunction on page 197).
NOTE: Your vehicle’s tire pressures will drop in cold
ambient temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light
appears, inflate the tires before driving. The tires will
lose one PSI for every 10° F (6° C) drop in outside
temperature. Proper tire pressures help protect tires
from potholes and improve range when properly
inflated.
WARNING: Under-inflation is the most common
cause of tire failures and can cause a tire to
overheat, resulting in severe tire cracking, tread
separation, or blowout, resulting in unexpected
loss of vehicle control and increased risk of injury.
Under-inflation also reduces the vehicle's range
and tire tread life.
WARNING: Check tire pressures using an accurate
pressure gauge when tires are cold. It takes only
about one mile (1.6 km) of driving to warm up the
tires sufficiently to affect tire pressures. Parking
the vehicle in direct sunlight or in hot weather can
also affect tire pressures. If you must check warm
tires, expect increased pressures. Do not let air out
of warm tires in an attempt to match
recommended cold tire pressures. A hot tire at or
below the recommended cold tire inflation
pressure is dangerously under-inflated.

Checking and Adjusting Tire Pressures
Follow these steps when tires are cold and Model X has
been stationary for over three hours:
1. Refer to the Tire and Loading Information label
located on the driver’s center door pillar for the
target tire pressure.
2. Remove the valve cap.
3. Firmly press an accurate tire pressure gauge onto the
valve to measure pressure.

The Tire Pressure indicator light on the
instrument panel alerts you if one or more
tires is under- or over-inflated.

4. If required, add or remove air to reach the
recommended pressure.
NOTE: You can release air by pressing the metal stem
in the center of the valve.
5. Re-check pressure using the accurate tire gauge.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary until the tire
pressure is correct.
7. Reinstall the valve cap to prevent dirt from entering.
Periodically check the valve for damage and leaks.

Maintenance

193

Tire Care and Maintenance
Inspecting and Maintaining Tires
Regularly inspect the tread and side walls for any sign of
distortion (bulges), foreign objects, cuts or wear.
WARNING: Do not drive Model X if a tire is
damaged, excessively worn, or inflated to an
incorrect pressure. Check tires regularly for wear,
and ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure
of the ply/cord structure.

Tire Wear
Adequate tread depth is important for proper tire
performance. Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32”
(3 mm) are more likely to hydroplane in wet conditions
and should not be used. Tires with a tread depth less
than 5/32” (4 mm) do not perform well in snow and
slush and should not be used when driving in winter
conditions.
Model X is originally fitted with tires that have wear
indicators molded into the tread pattern. When the
tread has been worn down to 3/32” (2 mm), the
indicators start to appear at the surface of the tread
pattern, producing the effect of a continuous band of
rubber across the width of the tire. For optimal
performance and safety, Tesla recommends replacing
tires before the wear indicators are visible.
To improve vehicle handling characteristics and minimize
hydroplaning in wet conditions, put tires with the most
tread on the rear of the car.

Tire Rotation, Balance, and Wheel
Alignment
Tesla recommends rotating the tires every 6,250 miles
(10,000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32 in (1.5
mm) or greater, whichever comes first.
Tire rotation is an essential part of tire maintenance. It
helps maintain an even treadwear pattern which
enhances the tire's overall wear quality, decreases road
noise and maximizes tire life.
Vehicles with staggered wheels and non-directional tires
can be rotated side-to-side (left-to-right) but not frontto-back as the front and rear tire size is different. Leftto-right rotation can increase tread life by changing the
direction of rotation for each tire and balancing shoulder
wear.
Unbalanced wheels (sometimes noticeable as vibration
through the steering yoke (or steering wheel)) affect
vehicle handling and tire life. Even with regular use,
wheels can get out of balance. Therefore, they should be
balanced as required.

194

If tire wear is uneven (on one side of the tire only) or
becomes abnormally excessive, check the wheel
alignment. If the tires need to be serviced, such as
rotated or replaced, reset the tire configuration (see Tire
Configuration on page 196) to improve your driving
experience.

Punctured Tires
A puncture eventually causes the tire to lose pressure,
which is why it is important to check tire pressures
frequently. Permanently repair or replace punctured or
damaged tires as soon as possible.
Your tubeless tires may not leak when penetrated,
provided the object remains in the tire. If, however, you
feel a sudden vibration or ride disturbance while driving,
or you suspect a tire is damaged, immediately reduce
your speed. Drive slowly, while avoiding heavy braking
or sharp steering and, when safe to do so, stop the
vehicle. Arrange to have Model X transported to a Tesla
Service Center, or to a nearby tire repair center.
NOTE: In some cases, you can temporarily repair small
tire punctures (under 1/4” (6 mm)) using an optional tire
repair kit available from Tesla. This allows you to slowly
drive Model X to Tesla or to a nearby tire repair facility.
WARNING: Do not drive with a punctured tire that
has not been repaired, even if the puncture has not
caused the tire to deflate. A punctured tire can
deflate suddenly at any time.

Flat Spots
If Model X is stationary for a long period, tires can form
flat spots. When Model X is driven, these flat spots
cause a vibration which gradually disappears as the tires
warm up and regain their original shape.
To minimize flat spots during storage, inflate tires to the
maximum pressure indicated on the tire wall. Then,
before driving, release air to adjust tire pressure to the
recommended levels.

Improving Tire Mileage
To improve the mileage you get from your tires, maintain
tires at the recommended tire pressures, observe speed
limits and advisory speeds, and avoid:
• Pulling away quickly, or hard acceleration.
• Fast turns and heavy braking.
• Potholes and objects in the road.
• Hitting curbs when parking.
• Contaminating tires with fluids that can cause
damage.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Tire Care and Maintenance
Replacing Tires and Wheels
Tires degrade over time due to the effects of ultraviolet
light, extreme temperatures, high loads, and
environmental conditions. It is recommended that tires
are replaced every six years, or sooner if required, even if
tread depth is above the minimum.
When a tire set becomes worn, replace all four tires at
the same time. Choose a Tesla-approved tire which is
designed specifically for your vehicle. Most Teslaapproved tires can be identified with a Tx specification
(for example, T0, T1, T2). Tesla-approved tires are
designed to reduce road noise and optimize handling,
ride, and range. Contact Tesla Service for information.
If tires need to be replaced early, for example due to a
flat tire, we recommend replacing the tires in pairs
unless the other tires are within 2/32 in (1.5 mm) of tread
depth of the new tire. When replacing tires, it is
important to match the brand and model of the older
tires. Always place a pair of new tires on the rear if all
four tires are the same size. Always balance the wheel
and tire after replacing a tire. Consult with a professional
tire retailer and installer for further guidance. If you
replace your tires or install different ones, reset the tire
configuration (see Tire Configuration on page 196). This
resets the learned tire settings and improves the driving
experience on your new tires.
NOTE: Regardless of the number of tires replaced, a
complete set of matching tires is recommended for
optimum performance.
If tires other than those specified are used, ensure that
the load and speed ratings marked on the tire (see
Understanding Tire Markings on page 217) equal or
exceed those of the original specification.
For the specification of the original wheels and tires
installed on Model X, see Wheels and Tires on page 216.
If you replace a wheel, the TPMS (Tire Pressure
Monitoring System) sensors need to be reset to ensure
they provide accurate warnings when tires are under- or
over-inflated (see Automatic Reset of TPMS Sensors on
page 197).
NOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound
and tread design may result in temporarily-reduced
regenerative braking power. However, your vehicle is
designed to continuously recalibrate itself, and after
changing tires it will increasingly restore regenerative
braking power after some moderate-torque straight-line
accelerations. For most drivers this occurs after a short
period of normal driving, but drivers who normally
accelerate lightly may need to use slightly harder
accelerations while the recalibration is in progress. Go to
Service > Wheel & Tire > Tires to select winter tires and
quicken this process.

Maintenance

WARNING: For your safety, use only tires and
wheels that match the original specification. Tires
that do not match the original specification can
affect the operation of the TPMS.
WARNING: Never exceed the speed rating of your
vehicle's tires. The speed rating is shown on the
sidewall of your tires (see Understanding Tire
Markings on page 217).

Asymmetric Tires
Model X tires are asymmetric and must be mounted on
the wheel with the correct sidewall facing outward. The
sidewall of the tire is marked with the word OUTSIDE.
When new tires are installed, make sure that the tires are
correctly mounted on the wheels.

WARNING: Road holding is seriously impaired if
the tires are incorrectly installed on the wheels.

Removing and Installing Aero Covers
If your Model X is equipped with aero covers, you must
remove them to access the lug nuts.
To remove an aero cover:
1. Grasp the aero cover firmly with both hands.
2. Pull the aero cover toward you to release the
retaining clips.
To install an aero cover:
1. Align the aero cover with the valve stem.
2. Firmly press the center of the cover to secure it in
place, then work your way out to firmly pressing the
outer perimeter of each spoke. You may need to hold
onto the opposite side of the cover until all spokes
are secured.
3. Firmly press the center of the cap with your hands
(do not hit the cover with your hands) to ensure it is
secured.
4. As a final check, quickly pull each spoke to confirm
they are secured in place.
For Gemini wheels, press on the perimeter of the cover
until it aligns with the wheel surface. Press on the Tesla
“T” in the center until the cap snaps into place. See Parts
and Accessories on page 206 for more information.

195

Tire Care and Maintenance
CAUTION: To prevent the aero cover from falling
off, ensure that it is fully secured before driving.

Removing and Installing Lug Nut Covers
If your Model X is equipped with lug nut covers, you
must remove them to access the lug nuts.
To remove a lug nut cover:
1. Insert the curved part of the lug nut cover tool, if
equipped (located in the glovebox in some vehicles,
or you can use a small allen wrench) into the hole at
the base of the Tesla "T".
NOTE: The lug nut cover tool can also be purchased
at an auto parts store or through online retailers.

2. Push firmly on the lug nut cover until it fully snaps
into place.
CAUTION: Make sure the lug nut cover is fully
secure before driving to prevent it from falling
off.

Wheel Configuration
If you are installing new wheels or swapping them for
different ones, update your vehicle's wheel configuration
by touching Controls > Service > Wheel & Tire >
Wheels. This allows Model X to learn the new wheels
and provide more accurate status updates on your
vehicle. Select a wheel from the drop down menu that
matches the new wheels you plan to install on Model X.
Selecting new wheels in the wheel configuration also
changes the wheels that appear on your vehicle's avatar
on the touchscreen.
Ensure you are aware if your vehicle is equipped with
staggered wheels, meaning the wheels are different
sizes in the front and rear. Check the front and rear tire
sizes marked on the tire sidewall to see if they match or
are different sizes. If the wheels are staggered, take
extra precaution to ensure the new wheels you install are
staggered in the same way as the previous wheels.
NOTE: Changing your vehicle's wheel configuration can
impact range estimates, tire pressure warning levels, and
vehicle visualization.

2. Maneuver the lug nut cover tool so that it is fully
inserted into the hole in the lug nut cover.
3. Twist the lug nut cover tool so that the curved part is
touching the middle of the lug nut cover.
4. Firmly pull the lug nut tool away from the wheel until
the lug nut cover is released.

WARNING: Only use Tesla-approved wheels when
installing or swapping wheels. Using non Teslaapproved wheels can cause serious damage. Tesla
is not liable for damage caused by using wheels
not approved by Tesla.

Tire Configuration
To see the miles driven since your last tire rotation or
replacement, touch Controls > Service and look under
Last Tire Service. After the tires on Model X are rotated,
replaced, or swapped, update your vehicle's tire
configuration by touching Reset, or by touching Wheel
& Tire > Tires from the same screen. This allows your
vehicle to reset the learned tire settings and improve
your driving experience.
Ensure you are aware if your vehicle is equipped with
winter tires. Winter tires can be identified by a mountain
and snowflake icon on the tires' sidewall. See Winter
Tires on page 198 for more information.
NOTE: Changing your vehicle's tire configuration can
temporarily impact acceleration and regenerative
braking levels and should only be done after tires have
been rotated or replaced.

To install the lug nut cover:
1. Align the lug nut cover into position.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Tire Care and Maintenance
Tire Pressure Monitoring

TPMS Malfunction

Each tire should be checked monthly when cold and
inflated to the recommended pressures that are printed
on the Tire and Loading Information label located on the
driver’s door pillar (see Maintaining Tire Pressures on
page 193). If your vehicle has tires of a different size than
the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation
pressure label, determine the proper tire inflation
pressure for those tires.

Model X has also been equipped with a TPMS
malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not
operating properly.

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been
equipped with a TPMS that displays a tire pressure
telltale (Tire Pressure Warning) on the instrument panel
when one or more of your tires is significantly under- or
over-inflated. Accordingly, when the Tire Pressure
indicator light displays on the instrument panel to alert
you about tire pressure, stop and check your tires as
soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure
(see Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 193). Driving on
a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to
overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also
reduces range efficiency and tire tread life, and may
affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.
If Model X detects a fault with the TPMS,
this indicator flashes for one minute
whenever you power on Model X.

NOTE: Installing accessories that are not approved by
Tesla can interfere with the TPMS.
WARNING: The TPMS is not a substitute for proper
tire maintenance, including manually checking tire
pressures and regularly inspecting the condition of
tires. It is the driver's responsibility to maintain
correct tire pressure, even if under- or overinflation has not reached the level for the TPMS to
trigger the Tire Pressure Warning on the
instrument panel.

Automatic Reset of TPMS Sensors
After replacing one or more wheels (but not after
replacing a tire or rotating wheels), the TPMS sensors
are reset to ensure tire pressure warnings are accurate.
TPMS sensors reset automatically after driving over
15 mph (25 km/h) for longer than 10 minutes.
NOTE: After replacing a wheel, false tire pressure
warnings may display before you've driven 15 mph
(25 km/h) for longer than 10 minutes.

Replacing a Tire Sensor
If the Tire Pressure warning indicator displays frequently,
contact Tesla to determine if a tire sensor needs to be
replaced. If a non-Tesla Service Center repairs or
replaces a tire, the tire sensor may not work until Tesla
performs the setup procedure.
Maintenance

The TPMS malfunction indicator is
combined with the tire pressure indicator
light. When the system detects a
malfunction, the indicator flashes for
approximately one minute, then remains
continuously lit. This sequence continues
upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long
as the malfunction exists. When the TPMS
malfunction indicator is on, the system
might not be able to detect or signal
under- or over-inflated tires as intended.
TPMS malfunctions can occur for a variety of reasons,
including installing replacement or alternate tires or
wheels that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction indicator light after
replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to
ensure that the replacement tires or wheels allow the
TPMS to continue to function properly.
NOTE: If a tire has been replaced or repaired using a
different tire sealant than the one available from Tesla,
and a low tire pressure is detected, it is possible that the
tire sensor has been damaged. Contact Tesla to have the
fault repaired as soon as possible.

Seasonal Tire Types
Understand Your Tire Type
The type of tires that your vehicle is originally equipped
with depends on vehicle model and market region. It is
important to understand the capabilities of your
vehicle's tires and whether they are suited for summer,
all-season, or winter driving. Check the information on
the sidewall of a tire for information about a tire's
performance characteristics (see Understanding Tire
Markings on page 217)

Summer and All-Season Tires
Summer tires and all season tires are designed for
maximum dry and wet road performance but are not
designed to perform well in winter conditions. Allseason tires are designed to provide adequate traction
in most conditions year-round, but may not provide the
same level of traction as winter tires in snowy or icy
conditions. All-season tires can be identified by “ALL
SEASON" and/or "M+S” (mud and snow) on the tire
sidewall.
If driving in cold temperatures or on roads where snow
or ice may be present, Tesla recommends using winter
tires. If not equipped with winter tires, contact Tesla for
winter tire recommendations.
197

Tire Care and Maintenance
WARNING: In cold temperatures or on snow or ice,
summer and all-season tires do not provide
adequate traction. Selecting and installing the
appropriate tires for winter conditions is important
to ensure the safety and optimum performance of
your Model X.

• Set air suspension to Medium (see Air Suspension on
page 89).
• Avoid heavily loading Model X (heavy loads can
reduce the clearance between the tires and the
body).
• Do not drive the vehicle without the chains properly
installed.

Winter Tires

• Drive slowly. Do not exceed 30 mph (48 km/h).
Use winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy
conditions. When installing winter tires, always install a
complete set of four tires at the same time. Winter tires
must be the same diameter, brand, construction and
tread pattern on all four wheels. Contact Tesla for winter
tire recommendations.
Winter tires can be identified by a
mountain/snowflake symbol on the tire's
sidewall.

When driving with winter tires, you may experience
more road noise, shorter tread life, and less traction on
dry roads.

Driving in Low Temperatures

• Remove the tire chains as soon as conditions allow.
NOTE: Tire chains are prohibited in some jurisdictions.
Check local laws before installing tire chains.
CAUTION: Using non-recommended tire chains, or
using tire chains on other sized tires can damage
the suspension, body, wheels, and/or brake lines.
Damage caused by using non-recommended tire
chains, or incorrectly installing tire chains, is not
covered by the warranty.
CAUTION: Never deflate your tires to put on tire
chains. When re-inflated, the chains might fit too
tightly and cause tire damage.
CAUTION: Ensure that the tire chains cannot touch
suspension components or brake lines. If you hear
the chains making unusual noises that would
indicate contact with Model X, stop and investigate
immediately.

Tire performance is reduced in low ambient
temperatures, resulting in reduced grip and an increased
susceptibility to damage from impacts. Performance
tires (summer applications) have reduced traction in
ambient temperatures below 40° F (5° C), and are not
recommended in snow/ice conditions. Performance tires
can temporarily harden when cold, causing you to hear
rotational noise for the first few miles (kilometers) until
the tires warm up.

Using Tire Chains
Tesla has tested and approved the following tire chains
to increase traction in snowy conditions. Tire chains
should only be installed on the rear tires. The approved
tire chains can be purchased from Tesla.
Tire Size

Recommended Chain

20"

KONIG K-SUMMIT K67

Do not use tire chains on 22" tires.
When installing tire chains, follow the instructions and
warnings provided by the tire chain manufacturer. Mount
them evenly and as tight as possible.
When using tire chains:
• Inspect the tire chains for loose fittings and damaged
links before each use.

Cleaning
Cleaning the Exterior

Window Cleaning and Treatments

To prevent damage to the paint, immediately remove
corrosive substances (bird droppings, tree resin, dead
insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do
not wait until Model X is due for a complete wash. If
necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots
and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the
area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to
remove the alcohol.

Clean windows and mirrors using an automotive glass
cleaner. Do not scrape or use any abrasive cleaning fluid
on glass or mirrored surfaces. Follow the directions in
Cleaning the Exterior on page 199 for best practices in
cleaning the exterior glass.

Keep the exterior cameras free of dirt, condensation, or
obstructions. These substances can cause unclear
pictures or Autopilot and safety features to stop
working (see Cleaning a Camera on page 199).

To add a hydrophobic coating to your vehicle's windows,
apply the coating only to the side and rear windows, not
the front windshield—doing so may affect the visibility
of the autopilot cameras. Follow the hydrophobic
coating manufacturer’s instructions for application
details.

Follow these steps when washing the exterior of
Model X:

NOTE: Tesla is not responsible for any damage
associated with applying window treatments on your
vehicle.

1. Rinse Thoroughly

Car Wash Mode

Before washing, flush grime and grit from the vehicle
using a hose. Flush away accumulations of mud in
areas where debris easily collects (such as wheel
wells and panel seams). If salt has been used on the
highways (such as during winter months), thoroughly
rinse all traces of road salt from the underside of the
vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes.

When taking Model X to a car wash, Car Wash Mode
closes all windows, locks the charge port, and disables
windshield wipers, Sentry Mode, walk-away door
locking, and parking sensor chimes. To enable, touch
Controls > Service > Car Wash Mode. Your vehicle must
be stationary and not actively charging.

2. Hand Wash
Hand wash Model X using a clean soft cloth and cold
or lukewarm water containing a mild, high-quality car
shampoo.

If using an automatic car wash, Enable Free Roll keeps
your vehicle in Neutral and activates free roll for the
duration of the wash, while preventing Model X from
applying the Parking brake if you leave the driver's seat.
To enable, press on the brake pedal and touch Enable
Free Roll; or shift into Neutral.

CAUTION: Some cleaners and car shampoos
contain chemicals that can cause damage or
discoloration, especially to plastic trim pieces,
lamps, or camera lenses. For example, some car
cleaning formulas contain hydroxide or other
highly alkaline or caustic ingredients that can
damage exterior components. Damage or
discoloration resulting from cleaning products
is not covered by the warranty.

mph (15 km/h) or by touching Exit on the touchscreen.
CAUTION: Failure to put Model X in Car Wash
Mode may result in damage (for example, to the
charge port or windshield wipers). Damage caused
by car washes is not covered by the warranty.

Cleaning a Camera
To ensure a clear picture, the camera lens must be clean
and free of obstructions. There are two different
methods to clean a camera, depending on when your
vehicle was built.
For vehicles built prior to approximately January 12,
2023: Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying
water onto the camera lens with a spray bottle. Do not
attempt to remove dirt or debris by wiping an exposed
lens with your hands or a cloth. This debris can damage
the surface of the lens when rubbed against it during
wiping.

199

Cleaning
For vehicles built as of approximately January 12, 2023:
Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying water
onto the camera lens and drying it with a microfiber
cloth. Clean the camera lens every week during wet
weather (snow, rain, sleet) and every month during dry
weather.

CAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before
washing Model X to avoid the risk of damaging the
wipers.

CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive
cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the
lens.

WARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity
(for example, if using a pressure washer) towards
the charge port while Model X is charging. Failure
to follow these instructions can result in serious
injury or damage to the vehicle, charging
equipment, or property.

CAUTION: Do not clean an ultrasonic sensor (if
equipped) or camera lens with a sharp or abrasive
object that can scratch or damage its surface.

Cautions for Exterior Cleaning
CAUTION: Do not wash in direct sunlight.
CAUTION: Do not use windshield treatment fluids.
Doing so can interfere with wiper friction and
cause a chattering sound.
CAUTION: Do not use hot water, detergents, or
highly alkaline or caustic cleaning products,
especially those containing hydroxide.
CAUTION: If using a pressure washer, maintain a
distance of at least 12" (30 cm) between the
nozzle and the surface of Model X. Avoid aiming
the water jet directly at parking sensors (if
equipped). Keep the nozzle moving and do not
concentrate the water jet on any one area.
CAUTION: Do not aim water hoses directly at
windows, door, or hood seals or at electronic
modules or exposed cabling.
CAUTION: To avoid corrosive damage that may
not be covered by the warranty, rinse away any
road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel
wells, and brakes. After cleaning the vehicle, dry
the brakes by going on a short drive and applying
the brakes multiple times.

Cleaning the Interior
Frequently inspect and clean the interior to maintain its
appearance and to prevent premature wear. If possible,
immediately wipe up spills and remove marks. For
general cleaning, wipe interior surfaces using a soft cloth
(such as microfiber) dampened with a mixture of warm
water and mild non-detergent cleaner (test all cleaners
on a concealed area before use). To avoid streaks, dry
immediately with a soft lint-free cloth.

Interior Glass
Do not scrape, or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on
glass or mirrored surfaces. This can damage the
reflective surface of the mirror and the heating elements
in the rear window.

Airbags
Do not allow any substance to enter an airbag cover.
This could affect correct operation.

Dashboard and Plastic Surfaces

CAUTION: Avoid using tight-napped or rough
cloths, such as washing mitts. A high-quality
microfiber cleaning cloth is recommended.

Do not polish the upper surfaces of the dashboard.
Polished surfaces are reflective and could interfere with
your driving view.

CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, use
touchless car washes only. These car washes have
no parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of
Model X. Some touchless car washes use caustic
solutions that, over time, can cause discoloration
of decorative exterior trim. Avoid exposure to
soaps and chemicals above pH 13. If unsure, check
the product label or ask the staff at the car wash.
Damage caused by improper washing is not
covered by the warranty.

Seats

CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash,
make sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid
using controls on the touchscreen that can result
in accidentally opening doors or trunks while the
vehicle is being washed. Any damage caused is
not covered by the warranty.

200

CAUTION: Do not use chemical based wheel
cleaners or pre-wash products. These can damage
the finish on the wheels.

Wipe spills and chemical residues from interior surfaces
as soon as possible using a soft cloth moistened with
warm water and non-detergent soap. Wipe gently in a
circular motion. Then wipe dry using a soft, lint-free
cloth.
Although seating surfaces are designed to repel stains,
Tesla recommends regular cleaning to maintain
performance and an as-new appearance. Promptly treat
dye transfer from clothing, such as indigo-dyed denim.
Avoid contact with harsh chemicals, including certain
cosmetics. Never use cleaners containing alcohol or
bleach. Spot-test cleaners on an inconspicuous area
before applying to visible surfaces.

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Cleaning
If equipped with leather seats, note that leather is prone
to dye-transfer which can cause discoloration,
particularly on light colored leather. White and tan
leather is coated with an anti-soiling treatment. Using
detergents or commercially available leather cleaners
and conditioners is not recommended because they can
discolor or dry out the leather.
Vacuum cloth seats as needed to remove any loose dirt.
CAUTION: Aftermarket, non-Tesla seat covers may
inhibit the sensitivity of a seat's occupancy sensors
and may cause staining or damage.
CAUTION: The front seats are equipped with
microphones (see Active Road Noise Reduction on
page 14) that must not be exposed to liquids. To
prevent damage to these microphones when
cleaning, do not over-saturate the area of the seats
where these microphones are located.

Carpets
Avoid over-wetting carpets. For heavily soiled areas, use
a diluted upholstery cleaner.

Seat Belts
Extend the belts to wipe. Do not use any type of
detergent or chemical cleaning agent. Allow the belts to
dry naturally while extended, preferably away from
direct sunlight.

Door Seals
Wipe door seals with a damp cloth to remove any
debris. Excessive debris on the door seals can cause
paint damage when contacting surrounding surfaces.
Avoid using alcohol wipes or any chemical products that
can potentially deteriorate the coating on the door seals.

Touchscreen, Rear Touchscreen, and
Instrument Panel
Clean the touchscreen and instrument panel using a soft
lint-free cloth specifically designed to clean monitors
and displays. Do not use cleaners (such as a glass
cleaner) or alcohol-based gel products (such as hand
sanitizer) and do not use a wet wipe or a dry staticallycharged cloth (such as a recently washed microfiber). To
wipe the touchscreen without activating buttons and
changing settings, you can enable Screen Clean Mode.
Touch Controls > Display > Screen Clean Mode. The
display darkens to make it easy to see dust and
smudges. To exit Screen Clean Mode, press and hold
HOLD TO EXIT.

Chrome and Metal Surfaces
Polish, abrasive cleaners, alcohol-based gel products
(such as hand sanitizer), and hard cloths can damage
the finish on chrome and metal surfaces.

Cautions for Interior Cleaning

alcohol-based gel products (such as hand
sanitizer), bleach, citrus, naphtha, or silicone-based
products or additives on interior components can
cause damage.
CAUTION: Statically-charged materials can cause
damage to the touchscreen or instrument panel.
WARNING: If you notice any damage on an airbag
or seat belt, contact Tesla immediately.
WARNING: Do not allow any water, cleaners, or
fabric to enter a seat belt mechanism.
WARNING: Exposure to chemical cleaners can be
hazardous and can irritate eyes and skin. Read and
observe the instructions provided by the
manufacturer of the chemical cleaner.

Polishing, Touch Up, and Body
Repair
To preserve the cosmetic appearance of the body, you
can occasionally treat the paint surfaces with an
approved polish containing:
• Very mild abrasive to remove surface contamination
without removing or damaging the paint.
• Filling compounds that fill scratches and reduce their
visibility.
• Wax to provide a protective coating between the
paint and environmental elements.
Regularly inspect the exterior paint for damage. Treat
minor chips and scratches using a paint touch-up pen
(available for purchase from Tesla, depending on market
region). Use the touch-up pen after washing but before
polishing or waxing.
Repair rock chips, fractures or scratches. Refer to
https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support for
more information on repair locations and available
services.
CAUTION: Do not use cutting pastes, color
restoration compounds, or polishes containing
harsh abrasives. These can scour the surface and
permanently damage the paint.
CAUTION: Do not use chrome polish or other
abrasive cleaners.

Windshield Wiper Blades, Jets and Fluid
Topping Up Windshield Washer
Fluid

WARNING: In temperatures below 40° F (4° C),
use a washer fluid with antifreeze. In cold weather,
using a washer fluid without antifreeze can impair
visibility through the windshield.

The only reservoir into which you can add fluid is the
windshield washer fluid reservoir, which is located
behind the front trunk. When the level is low, a message
displays on the instrument panel.

WARNING: Windshield washer fluid can irritate
eyes and skin. Read and observe the instructions
provided by the washer fluid manufacturer.

To top up the washer fluid:
1. Open the hood.
2. Clean around the filler cap before opening it to
prevent dirt from entering the reservoir.
3. Open the filler cap.
4. While avoiding spilling, fill the reservoir until the fluid
level is visible just below the filler neck.

Checking and Cleaning Wiper
Blades
Periodically clean the edge of the wiper blades and
check the rubber for cracks, splits, and roughness. If
damaged, replace the blade immediately to prevent
damage to the glass and improve visibility.
Contaminants on the windshield, or on the wiper blades,
can reduce the effectiveness of the wipers.
Contaminants include ice, wax spray from car washes,
washer fluid with bug and/or water repellent, bird
droppings, tree sap, and other organic substances.
Follow these guidelines for cleaning:
• Clean the windshield and wiper blades using washer
fluid, isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, or non-abrasive
glass cleaner approved for use on automotive glass
and rubber. Inappropriate products can cause
damage or smears, and create glare on the
windshield.
• Lift the wiper arm a short distance away from the
windshield, just far enough to access the wiper blade.
Do not lift a wiper arm beyond its intended position.
If the wipers remain ineffective after cleaning, replace

Example Load Limit Calculations
How much cargo Model X can carry depends on the
number and weight of passengers. The following
calculated load limit examples assume passengers weigh
150 lbs (68 kg). If passengers weigh more or less,
available cargo weight decreases or increases
respectively.
Driver and one passenger

Mexico:

Description

Driver and four passengers

CAUTION: To prevent damage, never load Model X
so that it is heavier than GVWR or exceeds the
individual GAWR weights.

Calculating Load Limits

Description

Total

Vehicle capacity weight

954 lbs (433 kg)

Subtract occupant weight (5 x 150
lbs/68 kg)

750 lbs (340 kg)

Available cargo weight

204 lbs (93 kg)

When carrying cargo, distribute the weight as evenly as
possible between the front and rear trunks. For
maximum load limits specific to the trunks, see Front
Trunk Load Limit on page 37 and Rear Trunk Load Limits
on page 35.

1. Locate the statement “The combined weight of
occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX lbs or
XXX kg” on the “Tire and Loading Information” label.
2. Determine the combined weight of all occupants that
will ride in the vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight of the occupants from
XXX lbs or XXX kg (see Step 1).
4. The resulting figure equals the available cargo load
capacity. For example, if the “XXX” amount equals
1400 lbs (635 kg) and there will be five 150 lb (68 kg)
passengers in the vehicle, the amount of available
cargo capacity is 650 lbs (1400 ‑ 750
(5 x 150) = 650 lbs) or 295 kg (635 ‑ 340
(5 x 68) = 295 kg).
5. Determine the combined cargo weight being loaded
on the vehicle. That weight must not exceed the
available cargo load capacity calculated in Step 4.
WARNING: Trunks are the preferred places to
carry objects. In a collision, or during hard braking
and sharp turns, loose items in the cabin could
injure occupants.

Wheels and Tires
Understanding Tire Markings
Laws require tire manufacturers to place standardized information on the sidewall of all tires. This information
identifies and describes the fundamental characteristics of the tire. It also provides the tire identification number
(TIN) for certification of safety standards, and in case of a recall.

1. Tire category: P indicates that the tire is for passenger vehicles.
2. Tire width: This 3-digit number is the width (in millimeters) of the tire from sidewall edge to sidewall edge.
3. Aspect ratio: This 2-digit number is the sidewall height as a percentage of the tread width. So, if the tread width is
205 mm, and the aspect ratio is 50, the sidewall height is 102 mm.
4. Tire construction: R indicates that the tire is of Radial ply construction.
5. Wheel diameter: This 2-digit number is the diameter of the wheel rim in inches.
6. Load index: This 2 or 3-digit number is the weight each tire can support. This number is not always shown.
7. Speed rating: When stated, indicates the maximum speed (in mph) at which the tire can be used for extended
periods. Q=99 mph (160 km/h), R=106 mph (170 km/h), S=112 mph (180 km/h), T=118 mph (190 km/h), U=124 mph
(200 km/h), H=130 mph (210 km/h), V=149 mph (240 km/h), W=168 mph (270 km/h), Y=186 mph (300 km/h),
(Y)=vehicle's top speed (exceeds the "Y" rating).

Specifications

217

Wheels and Tires
8. Tire composition and materials: The number of plies in both the tread area and the sidewall area indicates how
many layers of rubber coated material make up the structure of the tire. Information is also provided on the type
of materials used.
9. Maximum tire load: The maximum load which can be carried by the tire.
10. Maximum permissible inflation pressure: This pressure should not be used for normal driving.
11. U.S. DOT Tire Identification Number (TIN): Begins with the letters DOT and indicates that the tire meets all federal
standards. The next 2 digits/letters represent the plant code where it was manufactured, and the last 4 digits
represent the week and year of manufacture. For example, the number 1712 is used to represent the 17th week of
2012. The other numbers are marketing codes used at the manufacturer’s discretion. This information can be used
to contact consumers if a tire defect requires a recall.
12. Treadwear grade: This number indicates the tire’s wear rate. The higher the treadwear number is, the longer it
should take for the tread to wear down. A tire rated at 400, for example, lasts twice as long as a tire rated at 200.
13. Traction grade: Indicates a tire’s ability to stop on wet roads. A higher graded tire should allow you to stop your
vehicle in a shorter distance than a tire with a lower grade. Traction is graded from highest to lowest as AA, A, B,
and C.
14. Temperature grade: The tire’s resistance to heat is grade A, B, or C, with A indicating the greatest resistance. This
grading is provided for a correctly inflated tire, which is being used within its speed and loading limits.

218

MODEL X Owner's Manual

Wheels and Tires
Uniform Tire Quality Grading
The following information relates to the tire grading system developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), which grades tires by tread wear, traction and temperature performance. Tires that have
deep tread, and winter tires, are exempt from these marking requirements.
Where applicable, quality grades are found on the tire’s sidewall between the tread shoulder and maximum section
width. For example:
• TREADWEAR 180
• TRACTION AA
• TEMPERATURE A
The quality grades are described next.
NOTE: In addition to the marking requirements, passenger car tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements.
Treadwear

The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled
conditions on a specified government test course.
For example, a tire graded 150 wears one and a half times better on a government test course than a tire graded 100.
The relative performance of tires depends on the actual conditions of their use, however, and can depart significantly
from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, road characteristics, and climate.
Traction

The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are: AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent a tire’s ability to stop on
wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C
might have poor traction performance.
WARNING: Defective tires are dangerous. Do not drive if a tire is damaged, excessively worn, or is inflated to
an incorrect pressure. The safety of the vehicle and occupants can be adversely affected. Check tires regularly
for wear and to ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure of the ply/cord structure.
WARNING: The traction grade assigned to the tire is based on straight-ahead braking tests, and does not
include: acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning or peak traction characteristics.
Temperature

The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and
its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.
Sustained high temperature can cause the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead
to sudden tire failure.
The grade C corresponds to the minimum level of performance that all passenger car tires must meet under the
Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel
that exceed the minimum requirements.
WARNING: A tire’s temperature grade is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded.
Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat
buildup and possible tire failure.

Instructions for Transporters
DO NOT TRANSPORT WITH
WHEELS ON THE GROUND
The front and rear motors in Model X generate power
when the wheels spin. Always transport Model X with all
four tires off the ground. Ensure that the tires are unable
to spin at any time during transport.
WARNING: NEVER TRANSPORT YOUR VEHICLE
WITH THE TIRES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY
CAN SPIN. DOING SO CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT
DAMAGE AND OVERHEATING. IN RARE CASES
EXTREME OVERHEATING MAY CAUSE THE
SURROUNDING COMPONENTS TO IGNITE.

If Model X must be transported without a flatbed truck,
then wheel lifts and dollies must be used to ensure that
all four wheels are off of the ground. This method may
only be used for a maximum of 35 miles (55 km), and
must not exceed the manufacturer speed rating of the
dollies. With this method, Tesla recommends the vehicle
faces forward so that the front wheels are lifted and the
rear wheels are on dollies.
NOTE: Transporting Model X with the front wheels on
dollies is not recommended, but may be done if an
external steering yoke (or steering wheel) lock is applied
and care is taken to prevent the front wheels from
spinning.
CAUTION: DO NOT TRANSPORT YOUR VEHICLE
IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF ANY OF THE
WHEELS SPINNING.

CAUTION: Enable Transport Mode (see Activate
Transport Mode on page 225) before winching
Model X onto a flatbed truck. If Transport Mode is
not available or the touchscreen is not accessible,
self-loading dollies or tire skates must be used to
load the vehicle into the approved transportation
position. Tesla is not responsible for any damage
caused by or during the transport of Model X,
including personal property damage or damage
caused by using self-loading dollies or tire skates.

Do not transport Model X using any method that is not
specified by Tesla. Adhere to the instructions provided in
the following sections and observe all warnings and
cautions provided. Damage caused by improper
transporting of your vehicle is not covered by the
warranty.
NOTE: Tesla is not liable or responsible for reimbursing
services not dispatched through Tesla Roadside
Assistance.

Approved Methods for Transporting
A flatbed truck or comparable transport vehicle is the
recommended method of transporting Model X. The
vehicle can face either direction when using a flatbed.

224

NOTE: Transport Mode is only intended to allow for
winching Model X onto a flatbed truck or repositioning
the vehicle out of a parking space. While in Transport
Mode, the tires are allowed to rotate slowly (under 3
mph or 5 km/h) and for a very short distance (less than
30 feet or 10 meters). See Activate Transport Mode on
page 225. Exceeding these boundaries can lead to
significant damage and overheating that is not covered
by the warranty.
WARNING: Model X is equipped with high voltage
components that may be compromised as a result
of a collision (see High Voltage Components on
page 177). Before transporting Model X, it is
important to assume these components are

227

Running Out of Range
NOTE: In the unlikely event your vehicle runs out of
range while driving, pull over when safe to do so and
contact Tesla Roadside Assistance on page 223 or your
preferred tow provider.
If Model X runs out of range, the low voltage battery is
no longer supported – and when low voltage is not
supported, the vehicle cannot charge. Therefore, the low
voltage battery must be supported by an external power
supply to allow you to charge the high voltage (HV)
Battery. Once the vehicle begins charging, the external
power supply is no longer required.
In the case of running out of range away from a charger,
the tow provider should transport Model X to the
nearest charging station and unload the vehicle within
the charging cable's reach. Once the vehicle is
positioned next to a charger, follow these instructions:
NOTE: If the vehicle is being transported to a charger,
make sure the tow provider does not leave until
confirming that the vehicle's high voltage Battery is
successfully charging.
1. Jump start the low voltage battery (see Jump
Starting on page 229). The low voltage battery must
be jump started to support the high voltage Battery.
2. Wait a few minutes. Once the touchscreen powers on,
plug the charge cable into Model X to begin charging
the high voltage Battery.
3. When Model X begins to charge, disconnect the
external power supply from the low voltage battery.
Before transporting to a non-Tesla charger, ensure your
vehicle is equipped with an adapter that accommodates
the specific type of charging station you will be using.
Even at a non-Tesla charger, you will need to jump start
the low voltage battery before you can begin charging.
CAUTION: Always ensure Model X has enough
range for your drive, or for being stored for an
extended period. Do not rely on the range
estimates displayed on the touchscreen or mobile
app as range can decrease faster than projected
due to ambient temperature, driving habits, wind,
vehicle settings (such as Sentry Mode), etc.
NOTE: Towing your vehicle as a result of running out of
range is not covered by the warranty.

Rear tire tread depth low - Schedule service
Inspect tires for rotation/replacement

What this alert means:
NOTE: This alert does NOT indicate that there is a flat tire.
Your vehicle has detected that the rear tires have experienced more wear over time than the front tires, exceeding
the recommended difference.
What to do:
It is recommended that the tread depth on all tires be inspected. As your tires wear during normal driving, the rear
tires generally wear more quickly than the front tires.
Tire rotation is important to balance tire wear evenly across all tires.
Failure to rotate tires as recommended poses a risk of hydroplaning and losing control of the vehicle on wet roads.
Failure to rotate tires also decreases the life of your tires, requiring premature replacement.
It is recommended that you schedule service via your Tesla Mobile App or with an independent service provider to
have your tires rotated when:
• The difference in tire tread depth between any front and rear tire exceeds 1.5mm
• Your vehicle has been driven for more than 6,250 miles (10,000 km) since the last rotation
Upon completion of tire inspection and any necessary tire service, update your vehicle’s tire configuration to
optimize your vehicle settings to your tires and clear the alert for at least 6,250 miles. For more information, see Tire
Care and Maintenance on page 193.
It is not recommended that you rely on this alert instead of routine checks of tire tread depth. This alert should only
be present when your vehicle estimates the tires are far beyond the recommended service interval.
This alert is calibrated for Tesla tires and is not expected to work with tires of different types or sizes, including
combinations of different tire brands or models. It may not display, or may display prematurely, on vehicles using
tires not recommended by Tesla. For more information on recommended tires, see Wheels and Tires on page 216.

Assist for low brake performance activated
To stop, keep brake pedal firmly pressed
What this alert means:
Hydraulic Fade Compensation is active. This brake assist function activates temporarily to make sure you have full
braking capability in conditions where reduced braking performance is detected by your vehicle.
When this assist function activates, you may feel the brake pedal pull away from your foot and notice a strong
increase in brake pressure. You may also hear a pumping sound coming from the brake hydraulic unit at the front of
the vehicle. This will usually last for a few seconds, depending on road surface and vehicle speed. This is completely
normal and does not indicate any issue with your vehicle.
What to do:
Continue to press the brake pedal as you normally would, and do not "pump" (repeatedly press and release) the
pedal as this will interrupt the function.
This alert will clear when your vehicle comes to a stop or you are no longer pressing the brake pedal. It may still be
displayed for up to 5 seconds afterward.
Reduced braking performance is usually temporary, and can occur for a number of reasons including high brake
temperatures after heavy brake use, or driving in extremely cold or wet conditions. It can also indicate that your
brake pads or rotors have worn to the point that normal replacement is needed.
If you continue to experience reduced braking performance which does not improve over time, please contact Tesla
service at your convenience for a brake inspection.
For more information, see Hydraulic Fade Compensation on page 87.

UMC_a012

Charging equipment communication error
Try again or try different equipment
What this alert means:

Your vehicle is unable to charge because it cannot communicate effectively with the Mobile Connector. The Mobile
Connector detects that it cannot generate or maintain a valid control pilot signal.
What to do:
First, confirm the lack of effective communication is caused by the Mobile Connector rather than an issue with your
vehicle. This is usually the case.
To confirm this, try charging the vehicle using different external charging equipment.
• If the vehicle begins charging, the issue was likely with the Mobile Connector.
• If the vehicle still does not charge, the issue may be with the vehicle.
Inspect the charge port inlet and the Mobile Connector handle for any obstructions (use a flashlight as necessary).
Make sure any obstruction has been removed and any moisture has been allowed to dry, then try re-inserting the
Mobile Connector handle into the charge port.
This alert is usually specific to external charging equipment and power sources and does not typically indicate an
issue with your vehicle that can be resolved by scheduling service.
You can also try charging your vehicle using a Tesla Supercharger or Destination Charging location, all of which can
be located through the map on your vehicle's touchscreen display. See Maps and Navigation on page 165 for more
details.

Event Data Recorder (EDR)
Model X is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR).
The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash
or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag
deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data to better
understand how the vehicle's systems performed. The
EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle
dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time,
typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in Model X is
designed to record data such as:

and research by Tesla and its partners for the
improvement and design of our vehicles and systems; to
defend Tesla; and as otherwise may be required by law.
In servicing your vehicle, Tesla can potentially resolve
issues remotely simply by reviewing your vehicle’s data
log.

• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts
were buckled/fastened;

Tesla’s telematics system wirelessly transmits vehicle
information to Tesla on a periodic basis. The data is used
as previously described and helps ensure the proper
maintenance of your vehicle. Additional Model X
features may use your vehicle’s telematics system and
the information provided, including features such as
charging reminders, software updates, and remote
access to, and control of, various systems of your
vehicle.

• How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the
accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,

Tesla does not disclose the data recorded in your vehicle
to any third party except when:

• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;

• How fast the vehicle was traveling.
The data can help provide a better understanding of the
circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.
NOTE: EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a
non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by
the EDR under normal driving conditions and no
personal data (for example, name, gender, age, and
crash location) is recorded. However, other parties, such
as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with
the type of personally identifying data routinely
acquired during a crash investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is
required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed.
In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties,
such as law enforcement, that have the special
equipment, can read the information if they have access
to the vehicle or the EDR. Tesla may also access the EDR
remotely in some crash circumstances.

Vehicle Telematics
Model X is equipped with electronic modules that
monitor and record data from various vehicle systems,
including the motor, Autopilot components, Battery,
braking and electrical systems. The electronic modules
record information about various driving and vehicle
conditions, including braking, acceleration, trip and
other related information regarding your vehicle. These
modules also record information about the vehicle’s
features such as charging events and status, the
enabling/disabling of various systems, diagnostic
trouble codes, VIN, speed, direction and location.
The data is stored by the vehicle and may be accessed,
used and stored by Tesla service technicians during
vehicle servicing or periodically transmitted to Tesla
wirelessly through the vehicle’s telematics system. This
data may be used by Tesla for various purposes,
including, but not limited to: providing you with Tesla
telematics services; troubleshooting; evaluation of your
vehicle’s quality, functionality and performance; analysis
284

• An agreement or consent from the vehicle’s owner
(or the leasing company for a leased vehicle) is
obtained.
• Officially requested by the police or other authorities.
• Used as a defense for Tesla.
• Ordered by a court of law.
• Used for research purposes without disclosing details
of the vehicle owner or identification information.
• Disclosed to a Tesla affiliated company, including
their successors or assigns, or our information
systems and data management providers.

Data Sharing
For quality assurance and to support the continuous
improvement of advanced features such as Autopilot,
your Model X may collect analytics, road segment,
diagnostic, and vehicle usage data and send to Tesla for
analysis. This analysis helps Tesla improve products and
services by learning from the experience of billions of
miles that Tesla vehicles have driven. Although Tesla
shares this data with partners that contribute similar
data, the collected information does not identify you
personally and can be sent to Tesla only with your
explicit consent. In order to protect your privacy,
personal information is either not logged at all, is subject
to privacy preserving techniques, or is removed from
any reports before being sent to Tesla. You have control

call 1-877-79TESLA (1-877‑798-3752) and in Mexico, call
1-800-228-8145.
NOTE: You can also use voice commands to provide
feedback to Tesla. Say "Report", "Feedback", or "Bug
report" followed by brief comments. Model X takes a
snapshot of its systems, including your current location,
vehicle diagnostic data, and screen captures of the
touchscreen and instrument panel. Tesla periodically
reviews these notes and uses them to continue
improving Model X.

Reporting Safety Defects - US
If you believe that Model X has a defect which could
cause a crash or could cause injury or death, you should
immediately inform the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) in addition to notifying Tesla.
If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open an
investigation. If it finds that a safety defect exists in a
group of vehicles, it may order a recall and remedy
campaign. However, NHTSA cannot become involved in
individual problems between you, your dealer, or Tesla.
To contact NHTSA, you may call the Vehicle Safety
Hotline toll-free at 1-888-327-4236
(TTY: 1-800-424-9153); go to www.safercar.gov; or write
to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety, 1200
New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. You can
also obtain other information about motor vehicle safety
from www.safercar.gov.

Reporting Safety Defects - Canada
If you believe that your Model X has a defect which
could cause a crash or could cause injury or death, you
should immediately inform Transport Canada, in addition
to notifying Tesla. To contact Transport Canada, call their
toll-free number: 1-800-333-0510.
